According to analysts at multichain wallet BitKeep, the BRC-20 token standard is a novel form of fungible token that “employs Ordinals and Inscriptions to create and manage token contracts, token minting, and token transfers, which are stored on the Bitcoin base chain."" Ordinals is a numbering system that assigns a unique number to each satoshi, or 0.00000001 Bitcoin

, enabling its tracking and transfer. Meanwhile, the “inscription” process adds a layer of data to each satoshi, allowing users to create unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.

The BRC-20 token standard was developed by Twitter user Domo on March 8. Currently, there are over 14,000 BRC-20 tokens deployed on Bitcoin compared to an estimated 400 million tokens on Ethereum. Despite its traction, BitKeep researchers wrote, “BRC-20’s creator has openly stated that the standard is worthless and that users should not waste money mass minting this fun experiment.""

gm. I'm glad that some people like the experiment. Some additional notes.
1. These will be worthless. Please do not waste money mass minting.
2. Due to how some inscription tools are set up, the 'balance' may be minted to the intermediary address used in https://t.co/mja39YGIow…

— domo (@domodata) March 9, 2023

On May 8, BitKeep announced that it would soon support the ordinals protocol and BRC-20 protocol on its mobile and plugin-extension platforms. A new Bitcoin NFT section will also be included in the BitKeep NFT marketplace, allowing for the display, minting, transfer and trading of BTC NFTs based on the ordinal protocol. Developers wrote:

“BitKeep will continue to monitor new protocols, such as BRC-21, and provide more diverse support and services based on market trends and user demands.""

Despite being enthusiastic about its outlook, Trust Wallet does not support Bitcoin ordinals. Meanwhile, MetaMask added a new feature allowing users to store ordinals in February. Cryptocurrency hardware wallet provider Ledger also supports the ordinals protocol. 

3/4 BitKeep will also be compatible with the #Taproot address format and support the BRC-20 protocol, providing asset display, transfers, and trading services for BRC-20 tokens.

Join us on social networks

To send and receive payments on the Lightning Network, users must first set up a Lightning wallet and fund it with Bitcoin. From there, they can create payment channels and start transacting. This article will guide users through the process, from setting up their Lightning wallet to making their first Lightning payment.

What is the Lightning Network

The Lightning Network (LN for short, or simply “Lightning”) is a decentralized system for instant, high-volume micropayments that prevents users from delegating custody of funds to trusted third parties. It is a layer-2 protocol — a computer network built on top of the Bitcoin base layer (layer 1), the actual blockchain. The Lightning Network uses the Bitcoin base layer’s high protection standards to secure the network.

Bitcoin is a payment system designed to be slow, and its transactions are finalized in as long as one hour; this is because Bitcoin assembles transactions into blocks spaced on average 10 minutes apart, and payments are considered secure after confirmation of six blocks, which is about one hour. This is not ideal for micropayments and smaller transfers that are typically inefficient due to high base-layer fees.

Imagine people waiting one hour to pay for a coffee or a train ticket when they scan their phone through the station gate. The high fees add up to make the whole payment process clunky, inefficient and too costly for everyday Bitcoin network transactions.

The Lightning Network solves these problems as one of the first implementations of a multi-party smart contract using Bitcoin’s built-in scripting. On the Lightning Network, payments are instant, atomic and are not recorded on the blockchain; therefore, they don't require block confirmations to finalize. Lightning can be used by retailers for their point-of-sale terminals, by individuals for device-to-device transactions such as remittance payments, or whenever instant payments are needed without the validation of third parties.

The Lightning Network allows users to quickly send and receive Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,746

 with virtually no or minimal fees while achieving a throughput (message delivery rate) of approximately 1 million transactions per second (TPS). Compared to Solana, with 65,000 TPS, or even Visa, which has the infrastructure to process around 24,000 TPS, the Lightning Network is by far the fastest payment method available.

To meet the increasing demand for Bitcoin payments and micropayments, the network will need to support a much higher volume of transactions, which would be impossible to scale on the layer-1 chain. This is why the Lightning Network is considered by many the solution to scale Bitcoin in a way that doesn’t affect its decentralization and without delegation of trust and ownership.

How to pay on the Lightning Network

Users need to get a Lightning Network-enabled Bitcoin wallet — where funds are placed into a two-party, multisignature “channel” Bitcoin address — to make Bitcoin Lightning Network payments. Understandably, the person or the business to be paid will also have a Bitcoin wallet with access to Lightning.

Most wallets are mobile due to a phone’s ease and frequency of performing instant payments. Examples of Bitcoin Lightning wallet apps include Muun, Wallet of Satoshi, Phoenix and Cash App, and they can be downloaded on both iOS and Android devices. Muun facilitates submarine swaps, a fast trade between on-chain and off-chain digital assets.

Submarine swap is a type of off-chain cryptocurrency transaction that allows for the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another. It uses the Lightning Network to facilitate fast and low-cost transactions. Phoenix (a non-custodial wallet) and Wallet of Satoshi provide nearly instantaneous safe payments with minimal fees.

Most wallets are non-custodial, meaning that the Bitcoin funds are under the custody of the owners only, and they have a multi-signature feature as an extra layer of protection for the private key.

By depositing BTC into a Lightning wallet, users open a channel, and that is their entry into the network. Even if it’s impossible to see, every time a user pays a new person or a new business with the Lightning Network, the user opens a channel with that counterparty.

This channel can be direct and created on purpose between two parties to transact easily. Alternatively, it can be a routing payment over Lightning, allowing Lightning transactions between two unconnected parties to use a series of pre-existing channels.

Once users establish a channel, they will access the entire network’s public channels, all stitched together and ready to route payments, with lightning nodes searching for the best route to perform the transaction. This is why when users pay a new retailer, they can do it instantly just by scanning the QR code, without having to open a direct channel.

Payments occur through a channel instantly, with near-zero fees, without going through Bitcoin’s base layer all the time.

Making a payment through the Lightning Network is as simple as any other digital payment method and can be done by following these steps:

Open the payer’s wallet on the Lightning page.
Click on “Send.”
Scan the merchant’s or an individual’s QR code button or enter the address manually.
Confirm everything is correct and proceed with the checkout.

Similarly, to receive Bitcoin with Lightning, the following steps may help:

Open your wallet on the Lightning page.
Click on “Receive.”
Scan your QR code button on the payer’s device or have the person enter the address manually.
Confirm everything is correct and proceed with the checkout.

The Lightning Network wallets may be suitable for keeping a small amount of Bitcoin for everyday expenses. However, it is important to note that manually entering a payment address on the Lightning Network can be error-prone and time-consuming. In contrast, scanning a QR code provides a more accurate and faster way of entering the payment address and, therefore, completing the transaction.

How to fund your Lightning Network wallet with BTC

In order to open a channel or process a payment, a user will need some BTC funds in the wallet. To upload Bitcoin to a wallet, here are the usual steps to follow:

You should set up your wallet to use the Bitcoin base chain (Bitcoin wallet) or the Lightning Network (Lightning wallet). Select the wallet network you want to use.
Go to “Receive” and click on it.
Check the transaction details are correct.
Scan the QR code or copy and paste the receiving address onto the wallet you’re getting your funds from.
You have the option to add an invoice for the payment. Click on the “Invoice” button to proceed.

Once you’ve received BTC and opened a channel, you can send and receive Bitcoin with no time or amount limits. The Lightning Network is still considered experimental and must be refined, and it is therefore recommended not to store a significant amount of BTC in a Lightning wallet.

Who runs the Lightning Network

The Lightning Network is an open-source project that was ideated by research scientists Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja in 2015. Starting as a way to address the significant increase in Bitcoin’s transaction fees, the project developed a new payment system built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. In January 2016, the duo published the white paper, and the project started gaining more traction among developers and investors.

The same year, Lightning Labs — the company developing and maintaining the Lightning Network — was co-founded by Elizabeth Stark. The organization released a beta version of the ecosystem for developers to test, highlighting the value that layer-2 solutions can bring to the greater ecosystem.

With increasing amounts of funding and interest around the Lightning Network, such an ecosystem is gaining growing traction among Bitcoin enthusiasts, especially in light of the Lightning Network smart contract set up, which may open opportunities in decentralized finance and other applications.

How to receive Bitcoin on the Cash App

To deposit Bitcoin into Cash App, Bitcoin withdrawals and deposits must be enabled within the app by taking the following steps:

Click on the “Money” tab on your Cash App home screen.
Select “Bitcoin.”
Click on “Deposit Bitcoin” to get started.
Copy your Bitcoin wallet address onto the sender’s relevant box.

A wallet’s unique address can be used to receive Bitcoin from a third party to your account and will change after each successful deposit to ensure more privacy. Users can deposit up to $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in any seven-day period. As transferring Bitcoin occurs in the base-layer chain, it may take hours for transfers to be confirmed.

How to use the Cash App Lightning Network

In October 2022, Cash App added the Lightning Network to the Bitcoin wallet to enable Bitcoin’s faster transactions with little to no fees. Here’s how to send BTC using the Cash App Lightning Network:

Click on the payments “$” tab on Cash App to view the home screen.
Select the QR scanner on the top left corner of the screen.
Hold your camera over the Lightning invoice QR code to scan it.
Follow the instructions to confirm and pay the request.

Similarly, the following steps illustrate how to receive Bitcoin using the Cash App Lightning Network:

Open Cash App and click on the Money tab.
Select “Bitcoin.”
Click on “Receive” Bitcoin.
Share the QR code or link with the sender and scan.

To receive Bitcoin with the Lightning Network, the sender doesn’t need a Cash App account to pay a user’s request, but the sender will need a Lightning-enabled Bitcoin wallet.

Moving funds with Lightning addresses (LNURLs)

The Lightning Network is gradually being adopted across the crypto community and service providers, including exchanges. Kraken was one of the first to implement Lightning in March 2022. Moreover, in April 2023, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced a Coinbase-Lightning Network partnership, meaning one of the most popular exchanges in the world will be adopting Bitcoin’s instant payment network soon.

In December 2022, Lightning addresses were added to the Lightning Network. A Lightning address is like an email address but for Bitcoin, a straightforward way for anyone to send Bitcoin instantly on the Lightning Network, ushering in a new standard for how value moves around the world.

LNURLs gained a lot of traction recently when Armstrong apparently failed to recognize the Lightning address of Cointelegraph journalist Joe Hall, missing a payment due to the writer and stirring some debate on Twitter. Lightning addresses are a crucial addition to Lightning payment services, even though they will take time to be fully adopted.

It’s 2023, and decentralized finance (DeFi) has emerged as a major trend in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, with the emergence of protocols and the promise of building a financial system “free” from the control of central authorities. However, despite its potential benefits, DeFi has faced its fair share of criticism for its lack of true decentralization.

Undermining the fundamental principles of decentralization, many DeFi protocols are still subject to centralized control and oversight by a select few. “DeFi is not decentralized at all,” said Samson Mow, former chief strategy officer at Blockstream, in a discussion with Cointelegraph about how DeFi projects are governed by entities that can change the protocols at will.

The decentralization illusion

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are touted as the future of decentralized corporate governance, functioning without a centralized hierarchy. However, DAOs have failed to achieve their intended level of decentralization. A study by Chainalysis revealed that less than 1% of all holders have 90% of the voting power, indicating a significant concentration of decision-making power in the hands of a select few. This finding highlights a critical problem, as DAOs were created to address the issue of centralized power.

Source: Chainalysis

This was exemplified in July 2022, when popular DeFi lending protocol MakerDAO was scrutinized for its centralized decision-making process. A new proposal was put forth to the MakerDAO community for the implemention of a new governance structure that would centralize power in the hands of a smaller group of stakeholders, including the project’s largest investor, Andreessen Horowitz.

However, there was significant pushback from the community on the grounds that it would undermine the decentralized and democratic nature of the project. This controversy also highlighted the ongoing debate in the DeFi space about the balance between decentralization and efficiency, and the challenges of maintaining a truly decentralized system.

Emerging promise

While there is concern as to the state of decentralization, there is also promise slowly emerging in the DeFi space.

A good example is Canto, a relatively new and fast-growing layer-1 blockchain solution in the Cosmos 

ATOM

$10.46

 ecosystem. The project has recently made waves in the market with its goal to truly deliver on the promise of decentralized finance by providing a secure and scalable infrastructure for building decentralized applications.

Canto is still in its early stages and faces significant competition from established DeFi protocols such as Aave or Yearn.Finance 

YFI

$7,296

. However, Canto’s unique architecture and focus on true decentralization have caught the attention of many in the cryptocurrency community. The project has been successfully launched without a token presale, official foundation, vesting rounds or venture capital funding. Moreover, Canto’s goal is to build a “free public infrastructure,” which means that its decentralized exchange (DEX) cannot issue its own tokens in the ecosystem, unlike Uniswap 

UNI

$5.00

 and SushiSwap 

SUSHI

$0.90

.

Due to the project’s promise to build an accessible, transparent and fully decentralized ecosystem, many crypto and financial platforms such as XGo are listing Canto’s very own native token, CANTO.

Strong foundations and community confidence matters

Of course, projects can have strong missions, but the crux of a protocol lies in its foundation and the confidence the community has in it. For example, in 2020, Uniswap, the highly reputable Ethereum-based DEX with a strong mission to promote financial freedom and inclusivity, faced heavy scrutiny when its first governance vote on the platform failed despite receiving 98% support from voters.

This failure raised questions about the strength of Uniswap’s foundation and governance structure. Despite having a strong mission, a failed governance vote highlights the importance of a solid foundation and governance structure to ensure the success and sustainability of a project.

Emerging projects like Canto once again boast an impressive lineup of developers and have the confidence of the DeFi community to back its talent. According to the pseudonymous “Spector,” lead developer at Alto, a free public NFT marketplace on Canto, it would be “interesting to try a feeless marketplace that is monetized via Canto’s CSR (contract-secured revenue) while respecting the royalties set by the creators.”

Spector also praised Canto’s core contributor Zak Cole, with whom he has worked, touting Canto as an “ideal sandbox for new ideas, with the expertise of Zak and other core contributors driving innovation in the blockchain space.”

DeFi needs to reorient itself

As DeFi continues to gain popularity, the debate around true decentralization will remain ongoing. However, as projects begin to pivot focus toward creating a truly decentralized platform that is accessible and transparent, the promise of DeFi is getting closer.

This shift toward decentralization will help create a more equitable and decentralized financial system, paving the way for a future where DeFi is a viable alternative to traditional finance. As the DeFi space gains recognition and traction, it will be interesting to see where the ideal sandbox will — or rather can — go.

USE CASE
Join us on social networks

The rise of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) spearheaded a new era of digital ownership and investment. With a record number of new NFT collections launched in 2022, the NFT market capped $50 billion in sales volume for the first time. As a fast-growing market operating entirely in the digital world, however, it didn’t take long for the NFT industry to become a haven for fraudsters.

A recent report unveiled that in 2022, more than half of the NFT activity on the Ethereum blockchain, the most popular network for NFT trades, was fraudulent. From wash trading to copycat collections, the NFT market entered 2023 with a set of critical issues that could only be solved by advanced market intelligence and analytics. Assessing a fair price for an NFT is already tricky, as tremendous gaps between the floor price and the price ceiling are not uncommon for collections. On top of that, malicious market activity only adds more confusion to users’ NFT investment or trade decisions.

While NFTs from popular collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) hold immense value in the market, it’s relatively easy to copy the visual appearance of apes depicted in the collection as image files and then create fake NFTs based on copycat material. The $1.53 billion sales volume of the BAYC collection in 2022 presents a lucrative market for fake NFTs as well.

The impact of counterfeit NFTs

Fake NFTs created by copying the image of original art can be difficult to detect in the digital environment, resulting in significant financial losses for buyers. The impact of fake tokens in the NFT market includes economic, legal and reputational consequences. Investors who lose confidence in the ecosystem due to fake NFTs are less likely to return to the market. Without significant demand, the prices of NFTs are bound to drop.

Without proper tools, NFT collectors can quickly get confused trying to find an authentic NFT on the marketplace and trace its history. Luckily, recent tech developments in artificial intelligence (AI) now allow for the prevention of NFT buyers from investing in fake content. NFT analytics provider bitsCrunch recently launched an AI-powered tool that checks major blockchains and marketplaces for potential copycat or forged NFTs.

Fake NFTs caught by AI

By analyzing over 800,000 assets on the top NFT marketplace OpenSea against the top-40 NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain, bitsCrunch found out that 144 copycat NFTs are exact visual matches to the BAYC collection. Moreover, 231 NFTs were flagged as near-exact matches, while “extremely similar” copies are as high as 814.

Over 140 fake NFTs are indistinguishable from the original BAYC collection. Source: bitsCrunch

The fake NFT issue is hardly exclusive to BAYC. Other trending collections, including Azuki, Otherdeed and CloneX, have tens of exact copies detected by AI-powered analytics. bitsCrunch detects forged material across blockchain networks and flags newly-minted and existing counterfeit NFTs by analyzing real-time data.

AI-powered price estimation for NFTs

Confusion across the NFT market also arises when users want to put a fair price tag on an NFT they aim to sell, as floor price — the lowest-priced item listed for a specific collection — rarely gives a reliable perspective.

Many factors, including trading volume and history, last traded price and the profile of previous buyers, come into account when deciding the final price of a digital collectible. However, AI can now aid buyers and sellers in the form of the NFT Price Estimation tool by bitsCrunch. Aiming to accurately determine the true value of NFTs, the Price Estimation tool uses analyzed historical info and metadata for an NFT combined with the social media hype around the collection to provide more accurate price estimates.

The AI-driven machine learning tool has studied over 30 million NFTs from more than 2,200 collections to apply advanced data and analytics, benefiting the user when making buying or selling decisions.

The full potential of the NFT space can only be unlocked via tools that fight against issues like wash trading and forgery plaguing the market for the last couple of years. Users need AI-powered advanced analytics and intelligence presented on easy-to-understand screens to benefit from market data.

bitsCrunch offers accurate NFT analytics and forensics with UnleashNFTs to supply users with reliable insights into the market. The platform provides in-depth analysis, research and statistics about the NFT ecosystem, helping buyers and sellers to make better decisions with each NFT trade.

Additionally, as part of its commitment to bring more awareness and data transparency to the NFT ecosystem, bitsCrunch has launched its startup program. Companies working with NFTs can join this initiative to get quick access to bitsCrunch tools for analyzing and managing risk via API. Equipped with AI-powered analytics, NFT creators, traders and businesses can detect and avoid malicious activities while making transactions, thus expanding the NFT ecosystem in a healthier direction.

Just hours after the initial decentralized exchange offering (IDO) for Cetus began on May 8, its hard cap target of 800,000 Sui (SUI) tokens has already been surpassed, with over 6 million SUI committed worth approximately $6.85 million at the time of publication. Developers claimed that the IDO reached its initial goal in less than 30 seconds after the sale went live.

Cetus is a DEX and liquidity protocol built on Sui and Aptos. The IDO, which is scheduled to take place from May 8 to 10, is still ongoing despite the initial target being reached. During the IDO, 20 million Cetus tokens (CETUS) are up for grabs out of a total supply of 1 billion CETUS. Users can commit SUI in exchange for CETUS at an exchange rate of 1 SUI to 25 CETUS. The rules and token metrics of the public sale, along with the price of SUI, would place the Cetus DEX at an initial valuation of $45.8 million. 

The IDO has a hard cap of 800,000 SUI. According to developers, when the total commitment surpasses this amount, “Each purchaser’s final purchase amount accepted by the Seller will be a portion of their committed amount, calculated proportional to all the respective committed amounts from all purchasers in the IDO.”

Although IDOs can surpass their initial goals due to popularity, others can also reach this outcome simply by the way their public sale is designed, i.e. ""surpassed"" on purpose. Like their initial coin offerings counterparts, investments in IDOs are considered to be high risk and can be subjected to rug pulls, scams, or lack of traction thereafter. 

A layer-1 blockchain created by former Meta executives, the Sui mainnet officially launched on May 3, along with listings of its Sui token. The SUI public sale took place weeks prior, with an offering price of 0.1 Tether 

USDT

$1.00

 per SUI.

Immediately after the listing, the price of SUI opened at $4.50 apiece with a fully diluted market capitalization of $45 billion before plunging 75% to trade at $1.14 at the time of publication. Before the listing, Binance introduced Sui LaunchPools, where users could stake either BNB 

BNB

$314

 or TrueUSD (TUSD) for a limited supply of SUI rewards. The LaunchPools reached nearly $4 billion in total value locked in just two days.

"What are liquidity provider (LP) tokens, and how do they work?","Providing liquidity to a pool could be another source of passive income in crypto. Find out here what liquidity provider tokens are and how they work.","1.
What are LP tokens?

Liquidity providers deposit assets into a pool to facilitate trades on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs) and receive liquidity pool tokens (LP) in return. 

Liquidity pool tokens are also called liquidity provider tokens. They act as a receipt for the liquidity provider, who will use them to claim their original stake and interest earned. These tokens represent one’s share of the fees earned by the liquidity pool.

LP tokens have other use cases besides unlocking the provided liquidity. They allow the liquidity provider to access crypto loans, transfer ownership of the staked liquidity, and can earn compound interest in yield farming. Compound interest is interest earned on the original sum deposited. For example, 10% annual interest on $1,000 is $100, while the compound interest in the second year is calculated at $1,100, so it will be $110. 

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs) grant their users full custody of their locked assets through LP tokens, and most allow users to withdraw them at any time after redeeming the interest earned.

From a technical standpoint, LP tokens are the same as other blockchain-based tokens. For example, LP tokens issued on DEXs that run on Ethereum will be ERC-20 tokens. Other liquidity provider token examples are the SushiSwap Liquidity Provider (SLP) tokens on SushiSwap and the Balancer Pool Tokens (BPT) on Balancer.

2.
What are liquidity providers?

In decentralized finance (DeFi), most tokens have small market caps and low DeFi liquidity with little availability, and finding a counterpart to match an order may be challenging. This is where liquidity providers become essential.

Liquidity makes it handy to buy or sell any given asset in a market without impacting price changes. Highly liquid assets have many buyers and sellers in the market, facilitating fast-execution trades at a minimal cost. In contrast, low-liquid assets have fewer buyers and sellers, making it more challenging to execute trades, which can lead to price slippage or high transaction costs.

Liquidity providers deposit two token pairs into a liquidity pool. Once deposited, they can swap between the tokens and charge a small fee for users who swap using their tokens.

Platforms such as Uniswap, Curve and Balancer are also called AMMs and are a fundamental component of DeFi. They are based on LP tokens necessary to allow platform decentralization and serve customers in a noncustodial way. They do not hold on to users’ tokens, but the automated functions will enable them to be fair and decentralized. 

For providing assets like Ether (ETH) to the pool, liquidity providers receive LP tokens representing their pool share, which will be used to claim any interest earned from transactions. LP tokens are always under the providers’ control, who decide when and where to withdraw their pool share.

3.
How do LP tokens work?

Once crypto users decide to invest in LP tokens, they can choose the liquidity pool and start depositing crypto assets to receive LP tokens in return. 

The LP tokens received are in proportion to the amount of liquidity provided, so if a user provides 10% of the liquidity to the pool, they’ll be issued 10% of the LP native tokens in that pool. The tokens will be added to the wallet used for liquidity and can be withdrawn along with interest earned at any time.

Providing liquidity to a centralized platform doesn’t generate LP tokens since the assets deposited are under the platform’s custody. On the other hand, DEXs and AMMs use LP tokens to remain noncustodial.

LP tokens should always be kept safe like any other crypto asset, as losing them means investors will lose their share of the pool. Still, LP tokens can be freely moved around different decentralized applications (DApps), and only withdrawing from the pool means losing the right to the share of the liquidity pool.

4.
How to get LP tokens?

Only liquidity providers can get LP tokens by contributing to the DEX platform liquidity with their crypto assets.

Plenty of DApps can be chosen to provide liquidity and receive LP tokens. From AMMs to DEXs, the LP token system is relatively common to many protocols. 

Platforms such as PancakeSwap, SushiSwap or Uniswap offer liquidity pools where users lock up crypto assets into smart contracts. Traders use that pool to trade their cryptocurrency, even the little-volume tokens.

LP tokens are mainly associated with decentralized platforms because they should preserve the protocol’s safety and decentralization. It’s possible to provide liquidity to a centralized exchange; however, the deposited assets will be kept under the control of the custodial service provider without returning any tokens.

5.
What are the use cases of LP tokens?

Other than representing a claim of one’s assets, LP tokens can be used across multiple DeFi platforms in ways that can accrue the investment’s value.

How do LP tokens gain value? They gain value as a fundamental component of DeFi, contributing to the smooth operation of the DEXs and AMMs used by these DApps. 

One primary source of passive income for liquidity providers is the share of transaction-generated fees earned by the liquidity pool in proportion to their investment share.

There are other use cases and streams of revenue for LP tokens. Here’s an overview of the main ones.

Collateral in a loan

Some cryptocurrency platforms, like Aave, allow liquidity providers to use their LP tokens as collateral to secure a crypto loan. Crypto lending has become a substantial component of DeFi, allowing borrowers to use their crypto as collateral and lenders to earn interest from their borrowers. 

LP tokens used as collateral are still an emerging trend, and only a few platforms offer the service. Such a financial tool is highly risky, and if a certain collateral ratio is not kept, borrowers may lose their assets by being liquidated.

Yield farming

Yield farming is the practice of depositing LP tokens in a yield farm or compounder to earn rewards. Investors can move their tokens manually using different protocols and receive LP tokens when they deposit them on another platform. 

Alternatively, they can use the liquidity pools of protocols like Aave or Yearn.finance, which help liquidity providers earn compounded interest more efficiently than humans.

Such a system allows users to share expensive transaction fees and use different compound strategies according to the effort and time they want to dedicate to this type of investment. One example of a compound strategy is lending out cryptocurrency on a platform that pays interest, and then reinvesting that interest back into the original cryptocurrency to potentially increase returns. Another example is using an algorithmic trading strategy to automate buying and selling of assets to generate profits that can be reinvested.

LP staking

Liquidity providers can stake their LP tokens to gain extra profit. It occurs when users transfer their LP assets to an LP staking pool in exchange for rewards of new tokens, just like how the bank pays interest on a savings account. It also incentivizes tokenholders to provide liquidity. Early stakers in a project can earn a very high annual percentage yield (APY), which decreases as more LP tokens are staked in the pool. 

Where to stake LP tokens 

LP tokens function the same way as other tokens supported by a blockchain network. For example, tokens issued on an Ethereum-based platform like Uniswap is an ERC-20 token and can be staked like any other token of the same kind. 

6.
Are LP tokens risky?

Some of the risks associated with holding cryptocurrency apply to LP tokens also. Taking special measures to protect one’s assets should always be a primary security concern.

Loss or theft 

Just like with cryptocurrency, LP tokens should be kept safe at all times and preferably stored in a hardware wallet, especially if the owner has a good amount of them. By losing access to a wallet — through a lost or stolen private key — the liquidity provider loses access to their LP tokens, their share of the liquidity pool and any interest gained.

Smart contract failure 

When supplying liquidity, a provider locks up their assets in a smart contract, which is always vulnerable to cyberattacks and fails if compromised. Despite massive improvements in the last few years, smart contracts have yet to become secure cryptocurrency tools. 

Therefore, choosing DeFi protocols with a strong network’s smart contracts is imperative. If the liquidity pool is compromised due to a smart contract failure, LP tokens can no longer return the liquidity to the owner. 

Impermanent loss

One of the most significant risks for LP tokens is impermanent loss, which occurs when the amount of assets deposited by liquidity providers exceeds the value they withdraw upon exiting the pool due to price changes over time. The best way to mitigate such risk is to choose stablecoin pairs when providing liquidity because they move within a smaller price range.","https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-liquidity-provider-lp-tokens-and-how-do-they-work"

 community recently voted in favor of a proposal deploying on zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) platform zkSync Era, paving the way for the DeFi protocol to tap into powerful performance improvements delivered by the scaling infrastructure.

A number of different zk-proof-powered layer-2 protocols are being developed by Ethereum ecosystem participants, providing developers with a choice of infrastructure to scale their respective platforms.

While Aave has yet to deploy on zkSync Era, it has announced its deployment of v3 of its protocol on Optimistic Rollup scaling protocol Metis. The latest version of Aave’s protocol is touted to benefit users across both protocols, with Metis users set to benefit from the provision of DeFi borrowing and lending services.

Ethereum.org highlights the main difference between Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups. The former processes transactions off-chain before publishing data on-chain, with a timeframe for network participants to challenge the validity of transaction data.

Zk-Rollups, meanwhile, execute transactions off-chain and submit large batches on-chain using a single proof-of-validity, with no need for the network to validate the data.

The team from Metis highlighted a number of ways in which users of its ecosystem can benefit from Aave’s deployment. This includes borrowing assets with less collateral with Aave’s “high efficiency” mode, improved risk management with supply and borrowing caps, and siloed borrowing to reduce exposure to potential market contagion.

Aave’s “isolation” mode also increases the pool of collateral assets, its cross-chain portals provide access to wider DeFi solutions, and its gas optimization also reduces transaction fees.

Aave is renowned in the DeFi space, with over $5.5 billion in total value locked in the protocol. V3 of the DeFi liquidity protocol was deployed on Ethereum’s mainnet in January 2023 following its launch on a number of Ethereum layer-2 protocols, including Avalanche

Following United States-based crypto exchange Coinbase announcing the launch of its global derivatives platform, key executives at the firm are meeting with industry leaders and policymakers in the United Arab Emirates.

In a May 7 blog post, Coinbase said CEO Brian Armstrong and some of the firm’s executive team planned to discuss the potential for the UAE “to be a strategic hub” for the crypto exchange. According to the company, it was working with regulators in the Abu Dhabi Global Market and Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority as part of efforts to potentially expand into the region.

“[The UAE is] exciting for us as a potential hub to build as well, an international hub for Coinbase that could serve not only in the Middle East but parts of Africa or other countries in Asia,” said Armstrong at the Dubai Fintech Summit on May 8. “I think the U.S. right now is a little bit behind in terms of regulatory clarity and some of the rhetoric from the top.”

On May 2, Coinbase announced the launch of the Coinbase International Exchange, a platform offering crypto derivatives trading. The launch came amid the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission potentially charging Coinbase with securities violations following the issuance of a Wells notice in March. Though Armstrong has sometimes been critical of regulatory clarity affecting digital assets in the U.S., he told shareholders in a Q1 earnings call that he had no intention of moving operations outside the country.

“The region is standing-out as a leader in the development of a web3 ecosystem, making it an attractive location to consider investing in,” said the Coinbase blog, referring to the UAE. “The vacuum created by other notable jurisdictions means that international counterparts, such as the UAE, are racing to fill the regulatory gap.”

Before its Wells notice, Coinbase officials, including Armstrong, had met with U.S. policymakers to discuss crypto regulations in the country. Chief legal officer Paul Grewal said the firm had meetings with SEC representatives “more than 30 times over nine months” as of March but largely did not receive feedback on its proposals.

The UAE has steadily opened up opportunities for crypto firms, seemingly to draw in capital and jobs. Dubai established a legal framework for cryptocurrencies and set up the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority in March 2022, taking advantage of the Emirates’ free-trade zones with separate rules and regulations.

The risk/reward ratio or risk/return ratio is a commonly used metric in trading that compares the potential profit of a trade with the potential loss. That said, it’s the reward traders stand to make for the risk they take. 

For example, an investment with a risk/reward ratio of 1:3 would mean that for every dollar the investor spends, they gain three dollars if the trading goes in their favor. The risk/reward ratio is decisive to cryptocurrency trading, whether for daily trades or crypto investment for the long run, known as “hodling.”

To gain a better understanding, let's consider it in the context of crypto trading.

How to calculate the risk/reward ratio

Assuming that the prevailing price of Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 is $2,000, a crypto trader might decide to enter a long position (buy) with the following parameters:

Entry price: $2,000

The price at which they purchase ETH.

Stop-loss: $1,800

Should the price of ETH go down, which is not in the trader’s favor, the stop-loss point is where they would sell the ETH acquired (for a loss) and avoid further losses. In other words, they’re risking $200 per ETH bought at $2000.

Take profit: $3,000

If the price of ETH goes up, the take profit price is the point they would sell the ETH, which, in this case, would be for a profit of $1000, a reward of $1000 per ETH.

Plenty of risk/reward ratio calculators are available online for cryptocurrency trading. Using the above example, here’s how to manually calculate the risk/reward ratio:

The initial risk is $200 per ETH (the distance between the entry price of $2,000 and the stop-loss price of $1,800).
The take-profit level offers a reward of $1,000 per ETH, which gives a risk-reward ratio of 1:5 ($200 risk divided by $1,000 reward).

Here is the formula for the risk/reward ratio:

What are the pros, cons, buts and howevers of the risk/reward ratio?

The risk/reward ratio helps traders evaluate a trade’s potential risks and rewards, and make decisions accordingly. It allows traders to manage risk effectively by setting stop-loss orders and take-profit levels, limiting potential losses while maximizing profits.

However, the risk/reward ratio is a measure for managing risk and does not guarantee success in trading because:

It is based on assumptions about an asset’s future price movement, which may not always hold.
It can be oversimplified and may not consider other important factors, such as market conditions, liquidity and transaction costs.

For example, if the market suddenly becomes highly volatile (high price fluctuations), a trader may need to keep adjusting stop-loss or take profit levels. And the crypto market is known to breed volatility.

After calculating the risk/reward ratio, the trader should evaluate whether it suits their trading strategy and risk tolerance. That said, one cannot rely solely on the risk/reward ratio for cryptocurrency trading. Traders should use it with other risk management strategies, trading plans and discipline to succeed.

How to optimize the risk/reward ratio?

What is considered a good risk/reward ratio? While 1:2 is regarded as a practical and optimal risk/reward ratio in crypto (as well as traditional trading), there are no fixed rules for its use, with the ratio depending on the traders’ expectations and strategy.

Arriving at the optimal risk/reward ratio requires balancing a trade’s potential risk and reward, which depends on risk tolerance and trading strategy. Several metrics can accompany the risk/reward ratio or enable traders to optimize it.

Here’s how to use the risk/reward ratio for crypto trading:

Position size

The position size is not necessarily a measure or metric; it’s the amount of capital (crypto asset capital) allocated to each trade. Determining the position size is a critical component of trading risk management strategy. It helps to control potential losses and profits of a trade.

The position size directly impacts the risk/reward ratio, i.e., a larger position size can increase a trade’s potential profit and the possible loss. Conversely, a smaller position size may limit the potential profit and loss.

Win rate

The win rate is the percentage of the total number of profitable trades to the total trades, measuring how often a trader’s trades are profitable. A high win rate means the trader consistently makes profitable trades and doesn’t need to rely as heavily on big winning trades. Accordingly, the trader can afford to use a lower and safer risk/reward ratio, which can still be profitable because the trader is winning more often.

On the other hand, a lower win rate means that the trader needs to rely more on big winning trades to make money and face the volatility risks associated with a more significant risk/reward ratio.

Maximum drawdown (MDD)

Maximum drawdown is an essential metric for traders to consider when assessing their trades’ risk/reward ratio. It is the biggest percentage drop a trader sees in their trading account from its highest value before the decline started. It measures the largest amount of money a trader lost in their account from its highest value before things started going downhill. So how does maximum drawdown influence the risk/reward ratio?

Suppose a trader has a risk/reward ratio of 1:2, meaning they risk $1 to potentially make a profit of $2. Furthermore, imagine the maximum drawdown of the trading strategy is 50%. In that case, the trader could potentially lose half of their trading account before the strategy turns around and becomes profitable again.

As such, even though the risk/reward ratio is favorable, the strategy’s overall risk may be too high. One way around this is to use a narrow stop-loss and avoid the potential loss of the maximum drawdown. However, this translates to a lesser risk/reward ratio.

It’s about finding the right balance between managing the maximum drawdown risk and maintaining a favorable risk/reward ratio.

Expectancy

Expectancy measures the likelihood of making a profit over the long term on a series of trades or investments. It measures the long-term profitability of a trading or investing strategy. Positive expectancy is more or less like the ultimate objective of all trading initiatives.

Akin to the win rate, the loss rate is the unprofitable percentage. The average win and loss sizes are the average profits and losses on a series of trades or investments.

The risk/reward ratio plays a critical role in determining expectancy. A high risk/reward ratio means that potential profits are more considerable than potential losses. This means that if a trader wins 33% of their trades with, say, a 1:2 risk-reward ratio, their average win is twice as large as the average loss, which, in turn, translates to higher expectancy. Conversely, for a low risk/reward ratio, traders would need more wins (win rate).

What factors should be considered while determining the risk/reward ratio in cryptocurrency trading?

Several factors often influence cryptocurrency trading and the risk traders will take to hit the desired profits. Here are a few:

Crypto market volatility

If there is one thing the cryptocurrency ecosystem is infamous for — apart from the hacks and rug pulls — it is how volatile its trading scene is. Set risk/reward ratio with careful consideration.

Liquidity

In simple words, liquidity refers to reserves, tokens or token pools readily available for exchange. It translates to the ability to buy and sell assets quickly and easily. Low liquidity of a crypto asset can increase the risk of trading and make it more challenging to realize profits.

Strength of underlying technology

What the trading token stands for, i.e., the problem it solves and the potential of its growth, greatly influences the risk of trading with it. The more reputed and established the token, the lower the risk of trading with it.

Regulatory landscape

The cryptocurrency world has a long way to go regarding the regulations jurisdictions create around it. And each new (or updated) law directly impacts trading sentiment.

How important is the risk/reward ratio in cryptocurrency trading?

Just as a seesaw balances two opposing forces, the risk and reward of an investment opportunity must also be carefully balanced. The risk/reward ratio requires constant adjustments and vigilance to maintain balance and avoid the pitfalls of either extreme.

As detailed in this article, there are many ways to optimize it and several factors influencing it. While it is an important metric, it is not a holy grail solution that guarantees success in any crypto trading strategy. Understand and experiment with how it plays into the broader set of trading strategies and risk management.

According to blockchain analytics service Lookonchain, one crypto “whale” purchased 962.3 billion PEPE using 70 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and 470 Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 for an average price of $0.000003122 on May 5.

PEPE has, however, fallen 42% from its all-time high since then, according to CoinGecko. The crypto investor’s PEPE holdings are now estimated to be worth only $2.4 million, marking an unrealized loss of more than $600,000.

Despite the recent price decline, PEPE still holds a market capitalization of just over $1 billion, making it the 45th-largest cryptocurrency by overall valuation.

Since its inception on April 14, PEPE has attracted widespread attention, witnessing over $636 million in trading volume within the last 24 hours, and single-handedly burning more than 5,000 ETH in related gas fees via Uniswap trading as of May 5.

While the memecoin has witnessed extreme volatility in its price, the number of individual holders has increased steadily over the past three weeks. According to data from Dune Analytics, there are 144,534 individual holders of tokens at the time of publication.

The advent of memecoin mania has also driven fees on the Bitcoin network to surge to their highest levels of the last two years, following an enormous spike in Bitcoin activity involving BRC-20-related transactions.

Memecoins have played a role in the cryptocurrency industry since the creation of the most widely recognized meme-based cryptocurrency, Dogecoin

With memecoins having captured the attention of the wider crypto industry in recent weeks, a viral video has emerged detailing just how easy it is for anyone with an internet connection to create a brand new cryptocurrency from scratch.

A May 6 video from digital artist Johnny Shankman — who goes by whitelights.eth on Twitter — shows him completing a “speedrun” of creating and deploying an entirely new token, humorously dubbed “EASY_MONEY,” in just 27 seconds. The record was then beaten just a day later, clocking in at 22.45 seconds. 

The term “speed run” originates from the gaming community and is typically used in reference to completing a game, or level in a game, as quickly as possible. 

In the now-viral video, Shankman shows how any user can quickly create a new token by utilizing a program called Contracts Wizard, created by the crypto cybersecurity firm OpenZeppelin. The Contacts Wizard tool generates code for an ERC-20 token with a few quick clicks of a cursor. On the program, users can select a number of potential features for their token.

After the code has been created, Shankman then uses an application called Remix, which compiles the token’s smart contract and deploys it on a given blockchain network. In the video, Shankman opts for deploying his EASY_MONEY (EZ) token on the Ethereum testnet.

He notes in the comments section that the video was “for educational purposes only” and clarifies that by deploying EASY_MONEY on the Ethereum testnet, it is not a real token to be speculated on.

Notably, Shankman’s video was picked up by a number of large accounts on Crypto Twitter, being reposted by the likes of Loopifyyy, which has now seen the video gain more than 3 million views across a series of different accounts.

The viral popularity of Shankman’s post comes at a time where “shitcoins'' have gained drastically in popularity throughout the broader crypto ecosystem. The recent memecoin boom has been led in large part by an “entirely useless” frog-themed token called Pepe, which has seen its value surge more than 5,000% since its inception on April 14.

In a follow-up comment, Shankman pointed out that someone had actually created a token with the same name as his explainer but divulged that he “did not make it” and he would “not be buying it.”

Less than 24 hours later, a new video emerged from another account on Twitter, that showed the same process being completed in just 22.45 seconds, setting a new unofficial record for the memecoin speedrun.

A bot initiated the hack on BSC, which led to a more than $1.3 million loss. The attacker also targeted the Arbitrum network, with ARB/ETH deployments losing over $5 million. Twitter users claimed the token contract had a basic implementation error as the root cause.

The protocol confirmed the attack, paused all contracts and burned DEI tokens to prevent further damage. “We are currently in the process of comprehending the actual backing of DEI tokens,” said the Deus team on Twitter, adding that a “comprehensive recovery and redemption plan” will be created after a full analysis of the balances and snapshots.

DEI is used as a collateral mechanism for third-party instruments built on the Fantom protocol. Its price dropped 30% over the past 24 hours, data from CoinMarketCap shows. The stablecoin is trading at $0.20 at the time of writing, losing its $0.30 peg. Last year, the stablecoin also lost its $1 peg after the Terra collapse.

It is not the first time that Deus Finance has been hacked. The protocol was exploited in March 2022 in a flash-loan attack, resulting in over $3 million in losses in Dai

Binance is under investigation by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) national security division for allowing Russians to use the cryptocurrency exchange in violation of U.S. sanctions, according to a report that appeared in Bloomberg on May 5. There have been no accusations against the company or its executive in connection with the investigation.

The national security probe is being carried out in tandem with a criminal division investigation, the news service said, citing five unnamed sources. Binance is the object of several investigations in the United States, including a DOJ inquiry into Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations.

Binance limited services to Russia after sanctions were imposed on the country in April 2022. Still, it continued operating there, blocking only areas of Ukraine that were no longer under government control and servicing only non-sanctioned individuals, according to a company executive speaking to Cointelegraph.

The Justice Department is investigating whether Binance was used illegally to let Russians skirt US sanctions and move money through the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange https://t.co/AVgG55iSmx

— Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) May 5, 2023

Binance has also been accused of Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML violations in a suit brought by the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission in March.

Related: Brazilian authorities investigate Binance for guiding clients past stop order: Report

The company did not reply immediately to an inquiry from Cointelegraph, but it told Bloomberg in a statement that it was compliant with U.S. and international sanctions, and its KYC protocols are in line with those of traditional banking. Every customer is subject to identity and residency checks, it said. Furthermore:

“Our policy imposes a zero-tolerance approach to double registrations, anonymous identities, and obscure sources of money.”

In addition, according to Bloomberg, Binance “has been in discussions” with the DOJ about complaints that it had violated a previous version of sanctions against Iran.

Binance is not the only crypto exchange to face sanctions violation scrutiny. Poloniex paid a $7.6 million settlement to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control for violating sanctions against Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria, according to a May 1 announcement.

HOW TO
Join us on social networks

A transaction on the Ethereum blockchain is technically initiated by an external account owner (not a contract). For example, if User A sends 1 Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 to User B, the action of debiting from one account and crediting to another changes the blockchain’s state.

The change specifically takes place on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Ethereum transactions need to be broadcast to the entire network, and any node can broadcast a request for the execution of a transaction on the EVM.

After broadcasting the request, a validator can then execute the transaction and propagate the state change to the whole network. Transaction fees are incurred during the process of validation, and each transaction must be included in a validated block. There are different types of transactions on the Ethereum network:

Regular transactions: transactions occurring from one account to another.
Contract-execution transactions: transactions interacting with deployed smart contracts (the “to” address is a smart contract address).
Contract-deployment transactions: transactions with no “to” address (the data field is simply used to deploy the smart contract’s code).
How to check the status of an Ethereum transaction

Here’s a brief step-by-step guide on how to track Ethereum transactions:

Step 1: Select an Ethereum blockchain explorer

Some blockchain explorers are specific to Ethereum, such as Etherscan, Ethplorer and EthVM. Others support multiple chains, such as Blockchain.com and Tokenview, among others.

Step 2: Enter the transaction hash into the blockchain explorer’s search field

On Etherscan, for example, the search field is on the top, left-hand corner of the screen next to a dropdown that says “All Filters.” Depending on the tool, a user can search for information based on a wallet address, transaction hash (txid), block, token or domain name.

The txid is a unique identifier attached to a specific transaction. All transactions carried out on-chain, or those to and from external addresses, carry a unique txid found in the transaction details.

Depending on the platform, it can also be called a “hash” or “txn hash.” It usually looks like a string of random letters and numbers. On MetaMask, for example, a user can instantly see the txid upon clicking the “Activity” tab and selecting the transaction.

Other than the txid, traders can also use their public address (a string of 42 characters corresponding to their public account). In this case, they will be taken to an overview of their wallet activities, allowing them to navigate to the specific transaction independently.

Step 3: Click the icon for “search” or “enter” on the blockchain explorer

Step 4: Check if the transaction was successful or not

How to know if an ETH transaction was successful: Details indicating the state of the transaction will appear on the blockchain explorer. If the transaction was successfully validated and is now on the blockchain, it will say “success” or “successful.”

If there are no errors displayed, it means that the transaction was completed successfully. The ETH should be credited to the destination wallet or exchange account within 24 hours of sending.

In the event of an Ether transaction failure, on the other hand, several error messages can appear:

Error message or symbol: A red exclamation point or an error message saying “bad instruction” or “out of gas” means that the transaction was unsuccessful and the funds did not reach their intended destination. In the case of an “out of gas” error, users can double the gas limit they initially specified and try again.
Reverted: This pertains to a smart contract user error. It means that the user should double-check the details of the transaction.
Transaction not found: Either the transaction did not go through or it isn’t appearing on the blockchain explorer yet. Try using another explorer. If it still doesn’t appear on multiple ones, there’s a good chance it did not go through.
Pending: The transaction is still waiting to be validated or processed, but it was located in the explorer’s transaction pool. Sometimes pending transactions can still be canceled or replaced by a user.

How long does an Ethereum transaction take to process?

An average transaction on the Ethereum blockchain will typically take between 15 seconds and five minutes to process, depending on several factors. These include the amount paid to process it (transaction fee) and how busy the network is at the time of processing.

Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake blockchain after the Merge. However, transaction speeds remain roughly the same. According to the Ethereum Foundation, it’s a common misconception that the Merge drastically sped up transactions.

However, there’s a slight difference, with slots occurring precisely every 12 seconds post-Merge compared with every 13.3 seconds pre-Merge. In any case, the change is barely noticeable by most users, as processing still usually depends on network congestion and transaction fees.

When a transaction is initiated, it is logged into Ethereum’s memory pool (mempool) and waits for validators to pick it up. The mempool functions much like a waiting room where pending transactions are held.

Once a validator enters transaction data into a block and adds the block to the blockchain, the transaction is considered complete. It is said to be finalized and irreversible after six additional blocks have been mined and added on top of it.

By checking a transaction’s status, traders can confirm whether their transaction has succeeded or failed and how many blocks have been created since their transaction was added to the chain.

Why should traders check a transaction’s status?

Ethereum participants must pay gas fees to use the network to transfer funds or deploy smart contracts. The fees largely depend on the number of participants waiting to execute transactions at a given time.

Network congestion and demand are thus directly proportional to transaction costs. When demand is high, costs rise — the opposite is true when demand is low. In any case, checking a transaction’s status helps a trader monitor the cost of using the network.

It can also help users determine if the gas fee they paid is sufficient to have their transaction confirmed. Low gas fees can usually truncate or delay transactions, leaving them to remain pending for long periods of time, especially during high network congestion.

Such transactions will remain pending until the gas fees reach the required minimum fees on the network. If this happens, a user can resend the transaction by resubmitting it and increasing the gas fee while ensuring it carries the same nonce.

In addition to transaction status, Ethereum blockchain explorers can also reveal the following helpful information:

Timestamp: the date and time the transaction was added to the blockchain.
Block confirmations: the number of blocks mined since the transaction was confirmed.
Transaction fee: the fee paid to the miner or validator.
ETH price: the price of ETH at the time of processing.
Base fee: the lowest fee required to transact on Ethereum.
Gas limit: the maximum amount of gas the sender is allocating to process the transaction.
Nonce: a unique number marking each transaction executed on a user’s wallet; it increases by one each time a new transaction is sent.

By being aware of the above, traders can stay on top of their ETH transactions and make sure transactions are processed correctly and quickly. This helps to ensure smooth Ethereum transactions when sending and receiving funds or deploying smart contracts. Understanding a transaction’s status can also help users adjust their spending habits and optimize network usage.

April saw several hacks, exploits and rug pulls that resulted in a net loss of over $100 million among several DeFi protocols.

Amid the growing memecoin frenzy, the chances of exploits have increased multifold, with WallStreetBets — a popular trading sub-Reddit group — allegedly rugging its users for $635,000 just days after airdropping about $15,000.

DeFi protocol Level Finance was a victim of an exploit resulting in the loss of nearly $1 million. The attacker manipulated a “claim multiple” bug in a Level Finance smart contract to steal more than 214,000 native Level Finance (LVL) tokens from the exchange.

The volume of liquid staking protocols has dramatically risen in the past couple of weeks, overtaking decentralized exchanges (DEXs). From April 13 to May 1, the total value locked (TVL) on decentralized exchanges declined by $1.66 billion, while it increased on liquid staking protocols by $280 million.

Liquid staking solutions now have more TVL than DEXs: DefiLlama

Liquid staking solutions like Lido and Rocket Pool now have a higher total value locked than DEXs, making them the top category of DeFi protocols according to data from the crypto analytics platform DefiLlama.

Liquid staking protocols have just recently taken the top spot. On April 13, $17.19 billion of crypto was locked in liquid staking contracts, compared with $18.89 billion in DEXs, according to archived information. However, DEXs have experienced a $1.66 billion decline to $17.2 billion, while liquid staking solutions have experienced a $280 million increase to $17.47 billion.

RFK Jr. elaborates position on CBDC, crypto: ‘It isn’t just criminals who want privacy’

The U.S. presidential candidate has added anti-CBDC to his anti-establishment, anti-vaccination repertoire and has gained double-digit support among Democrats.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is challenging United States President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination in the 2024 presidential election, has taken to Twitter again to share more of his thoughts on cryptocurrency.

Kennedy criticized Biden on May 2 for calling the U.S. banking system “safe and sound” the previous day. “Today, bank stocks are crashing. The American people deserve more than glib assurances and perception management,” he tweeted.

On May 3, Kennedy condemned the Biden administration’s proposed tax on crypto mining. An environmental lawyer, Kennedy called the proposed 30% tax on energy used by crypto miners “a bad idea.” He said mining’s energy use was “a concern (though somewhat overstated),” and continued:

“The environmental argument is a selective pretext to suppress anything that threatens elite power structures. Bitcoin, for example.”

Jumping to “control” of cryptocurrency, Kennedy found more anti-establishment fodder. “It isn’t just criminals who want privacy,” he said. “Governments harass their enemies and crush dissent by controlling bank accounts and payment platforms.”

Related: Bitcoin at the barricades: Ottawa, Ukraine and beyond

Kennedy developed the theme of financial control further the following day with a look back at the Canadian truckers’ anti-vaccination protests in Ottawa in 2022. The Canadian government locked the bank accounts of people supporting the protesters. Kennedy said:

“It’s not outlandish to imagine that even here in America, your bank account could one day be frozen because of your politics, or comments you’ve made on social media.”

After all, he said, GoFundMe blocked U.S. accounts from supporting the Canadian truckers and planned to redirect the donations to other charities. Meanwhile, PayPal imposed fines on users for spreading “what they deemed to be misinformation.” Both of those decisions were successfully challenged under pressure, but Kennedy saw the hand of big government behind them anyway. “Often those private companies are acting out of fear of Congress or regulators, or directly at their bidding,” he claimed.

Please learn the difference, RFK Jr. ✌️https://t.co/Y5EHShNPFA

— Wicked (@w_s_bitcoin) May 3, 2023

“That is why I oppose CBDCs [central bank digital currencies], which will vastly magnify the government’s power to suffocate dissent by cutting off access to funds with a keystroke,” Kennedy concluded.

Kennedy first voiced his opposition to CBDCs in a somewhat confused tweet relating to the FedNow instant payment system.

I am voting for whomever is procrypto

if anyone is offended by this it means you hate liberty, entrepreneurism, small businesses and the underdogs

— Wendy O (@CryptoWendyO) May 3, 2023

According to CNN on April 29, Kennedy has 19% support among Democrats. He shares his distrust of CBDCs with several Republican politicians, such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is seen as a possible challenger to candidate Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.

In addition to Kennedy, writer Marianne Williamson has declared her intention to challenge Biden for the U.S. presidency. She implied dismay at the Canadian government’s blocking of bank accounts and crypto wallets in a tweet at the time and holds that “our government has become a handmaiden to a new corporate order,” but does not mention cryptocurrency on her campaign website.

South Korean authorities are seeking the extradition of the co-founder and former CEO of Terraform Labs, Do Kwon. The prosecutor overseeing the investigation believes his repatriation would best serve the victims of the TerraUSD (USTC) and LUNA token collapses, The Wall Street Journal reported.

South Korea is the place where most of the crimes Kwon is accused of took place, according to Dan Sung-han, leader of the South Korean prosecutors investigating the crash of the two cryptocurrencies, which erased nearly $40 billion from the Terra ecosystem.

“Given the nature of this incident, we think investigating the case in South Korea would be the most efficient way of bringing justice [to investors]”, the prosecutor said in an interview with the newspaper.

Kwon, also a South Korean citizen, was arrested in Montenegro in March and indicted on document forgery charges. Since then, authorities from the United States and South Korea have made efforts to extradite the Terra co-founder. He is also wanted by regulatory authorities in Singapore.

During a press conference after Kwon’s arrest, Montenegrin Justice Minister Marko Kovač said that a decision on his extradition would be based on “several factors,"" including the severity of the criminal offense as well as the location and time of the offense. Montenegro reportedly has no extradition treaty with either Singapore or South Korea. However, it has an old extradition agreement with the U.S. and has previously extradited American citizens.

In late April, South Korean officials indicted Shin Hyun-seong, also a co-founder of Terraform Labs, along with nine other individuals for the collapse of the Terra ecosystem on charges of fraud, breach of trust and embezzlement.

Prosecutors accused the individuals of earning illicit profits of nearly 460 billion Korean won ($350 million), the Korean daily KBS World reported. Kwon would face similar charges if extradited to his home country, Sung-han told the Journal, with a jail term of up to 40 years.

Terra was one of the earliest crypto firms that popularized the concept of algorithmic stablecoins. The ecosystem collapsed when its native stablecoin, USTC, depegged from the U.S. dollar in May 2022, triggering a snowball crisis in the crypto industry last year.

Ironically, the core value proposition of PEPE is that there isn’t one. The official website for the cryptocurrency features a disclaimer that describes investment in the token in the following manner:

“$PEPE is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. the coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.”

Currently, Pepe seems to be treading a similar path to its more well-known memecoin counterparts Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 and Shiba Inu 

SHIB

$0.000009

.

In 2021, DOGE surged by over 23,000%, mainly due to the vocal support for the token espoused by billionaire Elon Musk on Twitter.

Similarly, SHIB surged by over 1,250% during the 2021 crypto bull market after using Dogecoin as a springboard for its popularity.

Due to the lack of any underlying fundamentals, investment in memecoins is high risk, and they are notorious for extreme volatility and major swings in value. A closer look at some of the on-chain activity from Pepe insiders points to some concerning trades.

According to data from the blockchain analytics service Lookonchain, five addresses allegedly linked to the Pepe team made a $1.23 million profit in a thin liquid market. They purchased 8.87 trillion PEPE at a low price and sold over 90% of their holdings on Uniswap for a gain.

It’s worth noting that some of the top PEPE holders are centralized exchanges. However, according to data tracked by analyst “008.eth,”non-exchange PEPE whales have reduced positions recently, hinting at profit-taking that coincided with a price correction on May 3.

Anyone who has dealt with trading in traditional finance is likely to be aware of profit and loss (PnL). But is PnL in the cryptocurrency world the same? The ability to comprehend terms like mark-to-market (MTM), realized PnL and unrealized PnL will help develop a better understanding of the cryptocurrency a person holds.

Without a well-defined process to get insight into profit or loss, cryptocurrency trading may be overwhelming, and traders may struggle with what they are doing. PnL reflects the change in the value of a trader’s positions over a specific period. 

To gain a clearer understanding, let's examine it in the context of cryptocurrency trading.

Understanding the basics of PnL

PnL in crypto refers to the calculation of the profit or loss made on a cryptocurrency investment or trading position. It is a metric used to evaluate the financial performance of a trader or investor in the crypto market.

To begin, here are some key terms in PnL terminology:

MTM

MTM refers to the process of valuing an asset or financial instrument based on its current market price or fair value. For example, in the context of crypto trading, if an investor holds a certain amount of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,746

, the value of that Bitcoin will fluctuate based on the current market price.

The general formula for calculating PnL is:

Suppose the MTM price for Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 today is $1,970, while the MTM price yesterday was $1,950. In this case, the PnL is $20. It indicates a profit of $20. On the contrary, if the MTM price of ETH was $1,980 yesterday, it indicates a loss of $10.

Future value

Future value indicates the value of a digital coin at a future point in time.

For example, if a trader stakes Tron 

TRX

$0.0692

 worth $1,000 with a 4% yearly reward, how much will the person get back after a year? The answer is $1,040. At the time of staking, the present value will be $1,000, while the future value will be $1,040.

There will be a present value at the point when the trader stakes, but if the person considers the future as a whole, there could be countless future values.

There is a different way to use future value as well. Traders could ask how much to stake to get $1,040 in a year. If they know the present and future values, they could calculate the discount factor. The formula for calculating the discount factor is:

For the example given above, the discount factor will be:

Realized PnL

Realized PnL is calculated after traders have closed their position (sold the cryptocurrency they hold). Only the executed price of the orders is taken into account in realized PnL, and it has no direct relation to the mark price.

The mark price is the price at which a derivatives contract is valued based on the current market price of the underlying asset rather than the price at which the contract is being traded.

The formula for realized PnL is:

An example will help understand how to calculate realized PnL. If the entry price for buying X number of Polkadot 

DOT

$5.36

 is $70 and the exit price is $105, the PnL for the period is $35, which refers to a profit of $35. However, if the closing price of the trade was $55, the PnL will be $15, but it will reflect a loss.

Unrealized PnL

Unrealized PnL refers to the profit or loss that is currently held in open positions but has not yet been realized through closing the position. The formula for determining unrealized PnL is:

Donald has purchased ETH contracts with an average entry price of $1,900. The mark price of ETH is currently $1,600. The unrealized PnL for Donald is the difference between the average entry price and the mark price.

Unrealized PnL = $1,900 - $1,600 = $300

How to do PnL calculation

To determine PnL in cryptocurrency, a trader needs to find the difference between the initial cost of acquiring a digital coin and the current market value of the same coin. Various methods to calculate PnL in cryptocurrency are as follows:

First-in, first-out (FIFO) method

The FIFO method requires the seller to use the price of the asset from when it was first bought. Here is the process to calculate PnL using the FIFO method:

1) To settle on the initial cost of the cryptocurrency, multiply the purchase price per unit by the number of units sold.

2) To determine the current market value of the asset disposed of, multiply the current market price per unit by the number of units sold.

3) To find the PnL, deduct the initial cost from the current market value.

Suppose Bob first bought 1 ETH at $1,100 and a few days later bought 1 ETH at $800. A year later, he sold 1 ETH at $1,200. As he had first bought ETH at $1,100, this price will be considered the initial cost. Applying the FIFO method, Bob could calculate PnL as follows:

Bob's initial cost = (1 ETH x $1,100) = $1,100

Current market value = (1 ETH x $1,200) = $1,200

PnL = $1,200 - $1,100 = $100 (profit)

Last-in, first-out (LIFO) method

The LIFO method requires the seller to use the most recent purchase price of an asset in the calculation. The other aspects are just like the FIFO method. Here is the PnL using the LIFO method using the same example as above:

Bob’s initial cost = (1 ETH x $800) = $800

Current market value = (1 ETH x $1,200) = $1,200

PnL = $1,200 - $800 = $400 (profit)

Weighted average cost method

The weighted average cost method requires traders to determine the average cost of all units of a digital currency in their portfolio to arrive at the initial cost. Here are the steps to calculate PnL using this method:

1) Determine the total cost of all units of the cryptocurrency. Multiply the purchase price per unit for each transaction by the number of units of the asset and add the numbers.

2) To arrive at the weighted average cost per unit of the digital coin, divide the total cost of all units by the number of units.

3) Find the current market value of the cryptocurrency sold. Multiply the current market price per unit by the number of units sold.

4) To determine PnL, subtract the average cost per unit from the current market value.

Suppose Alice bought 1 BTC at $1,500 and a few days later bought 1 BTC at $2,000. She later sold 1 BTC at $2,400. Here is the PnL using the weighted average cost method:

Total cost = (1 BTC x $1,500) + (1 BTC x $2,000) = $3,500

Weighted average cost = $3,500 / 2 BTC = $1,750

Current market value = (1 BTC x $2,400) = $2,400

PnL = $2,400 - $1,750 = $650 (profit)

Profits/losses from opening and closing positions

Analyzing open and closed positions at regular intervals is an efficient way to monitor performance. An initial purchase a person makes in the market is an open position, while selling the cryptocurrency is termed closing the position. If a trader buys 10 DOT, it is an open position. When the trader sells those DOT, the position gets closed.

For example, if a trader bought 10 DOT for $70 and sold them for $100, the person’s PnL would be $30 ($100 - $70). Regular analysis of trades in line with open and closed positions helps a person trade in an organized manner.

Year-to-date (YTD) calculation

YTD is a way to measure the performance of investments made in cryptocurrency from the start of the year to the current date. Investors who regularly buy and hold cryptocurrencies for years can know their unrealized profits with a YTD calculation. The trader just needs to calculate the value of the portfolio at the beginning and end of a year and compare these values. This could be a calendar year or fiscal year, depending on the person’s preference or requirements.

Suppose someone holds $1,000 worth of Cardano 

ADA

$0.366

 on Jan. 1, 2022 and $1,600 of ADA on Jan. 1, 2023. In this case, $600 is the unrealized profit. Unrealized profit denotes returns that haven’t yet been converted into cash or cash equivalents such as term deposits.

Transaction-based calculation

A transaction-based calculation requires a person to calculate the PnL for each specific transaction. For instance, if a person bought 1 ETH for $1,000 and sold it for $1,500, the PnL for the transaction would be $500 profit ($1,500 - $1,000). If the number of transactions is small and a trader needs to calculate PnL for these transactions separately, a transaction-based calculation is an ideal method.

Percentage profit

The percentage profit method reflects the PnL as a percentage of the initial cost. An example will help understand better. Suppose a trader buys 1 Binance Coin 

BNB

$314

 for $300 and sells it for $390. In this case, the person’s PnL would be $90 profit ($390 - $300). To arrive at the percentage profit, the trader needs to divide the PnL by the purchase price and multiply the amount by 100 (($90 / $300) x 100). This amounts to 30%.

However, please note that these are simplified examples that do not factor in variables such as taxes, trading fees paid to the platform, market volatility, etc. In real-life situations, a trader will need to take into account the specific context when calculating PnL.

How to calculate PnL of perpetual contracts

Perpetual contracts are a type of futures contract with no fixed settlement time or expiration date. Traders can hold their long or short positions indefinitely, provided they have sufficient maintenance margin, which is the minimal amount of collateral needed for maintaining open trading positions.

When traders calculate the PnL of perpetual contracts in cryptocurrencies, they need to calculate both realized and unrealized PnL and then add them to determine the total PnL.

Here are the steps to measure PnL of perpetual contracts:

Again, this is a simplified way to explain the concept of calculating PnL for crypto perpetual contracts. When calculating total PnL in real life, a trader needs to take into account factors like trading fees and funding rates.

PnL calculations and associated tools

Understanding crypto PnL helps people know if their cryptocurrency portfolio is in profit or in loss. Gaining an insight into key parameters like cost basis, quantity, price of each trade and profitability of the portfolio helps traders assess the efficiency of their strategies and make necessary adjustments. Precise knowledge of the funds they have made or lost on a particular trade influences their upcoming trading decisions for the better.

Apart from PnL calculations, there are tools like specialized spreadsheets and automated trading bots that could help traders analyze their performances and zero in on profitable trading opportunities, regardless of their experience.

The vice president of the United States and President Joe Biden’s top advisers have held a meeting with several AI industry CEOs to discuss “concerns about the risks associated with AI.”

On May 4, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris was joined by nine top Biden administration advisers in science, national security, policy and economics, meeting with the CEOs of OpenAI, Microsoft, Google and AI startup Anthropic.

Notably, tech giant Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was absent from the meeting.

Before the meeting, the White House released a flurry of AI-related announcements regarding the funding of AI research facilities, government AI policy and AI systems evaluation.

The meeting focused on the transparency of AI systems, the importance of evaluating and validating the safety of AI and ensuring AI is secured from malicious actors, according to the announcement.

Advances in tech always present new opportunities and challenges. Generative AI is no different.

— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) May 5, 2023

Reportedly, the government and the tech CEOs agreed “more work is needed to develop and ensure appropriate safeguards and protections” for AI.

The CEOs committed to engaging with the White House to ensure Americans can “benefit from AI innovation.” No specific details were shared on what safeguards were needed or what the engagement with the government exactly entails.

Zuckerberg was absent from the meeting despite Meta working on AI for years. A White House official told CNN, “It was focused on companies currently leading in the space.”

Artificial Intelligence is one of the most powerful tools of our time, but to seize its opportunities, we must first mitigate its risks.

— President Biden (@POTUS) May 4, 2023

The Biden administration also highlighted its work to address national security concerns posed by AI, specifically mentioning cybersecurity and biosecurity, without going into specifics.

It said these efforts would ensure AI firms “have access to best practices” to protect AI networks from state cybersecurity experts from the “national security community.”

White House banks big on AI

On the same day, the Biden Administration announced it would put aside $140 million to launch seven new national AI research institutes, bringing the total to 25 across the country.

“These Institutes bolster America’s AI [research and development] infrastructure,” the White House said. It added the institutes would “drive breakthroughs” in areas such as “climate, agriculture, energy, public health, education, and cybersecurity.”

In a separate announcement, the government said AI development firms including Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, NVIDIA, Hugging Face and Stability AI will also participate in publicly evaluating AI systems on a platform from AI training firm Scale AI at the hacker convention DEFCON in August.

We've been hard at work on the Generative Red Team event we're doing at @defcon for a while and are excited that the @WhiteHouse announced it this morning. Here's more details:https://t.co/04oXIqXrKr

— AI Village @ DEF CON (@aivillage_dc) May 4, 2023

Finally, the White House said it would release a draft policy on how the U.S. government will use AI, which will be will be made available for public comment this summer.

Policies around the development, use and procurement of AI by federal departments and agencies will be drafted. It said the policies would be a model for state and local governments in their own procurement and use of AI.

Smart contract auditor CertiK claims to have blocked $160,000 from Merlin, a zkSync-based decentralized exchange that has been the center of a rogue insider “rugpull” that lost users $1.8 million last week.

CertiK shared the news of its successful $160,000 freeze of the stolen funds in an update to its 257,700 Twitter followers on May 5.

“We have successfully frozen $160K of the stolen funds with the help of partners,” CertiK said, adding that they’re continuing to monitor the movement of the stolen funds:

The firm explained that it tried to “collaborate” with Merlin to recover the funds stolen from the April 25 “rug pull,” but the effort was to no avail.

It led the firm to reach out to law enforcement in the United States and the United Kingdom in an attempt to uncover the identities of the pseudonymous operators:

“This lack of cooperation has complicated our efforts to validate and aid victims. We are focusing on working with law enforcement and have submitted information to relevant US & UK agencies.”

“We are exploring all possibilities to fight exit scams with the $2M we’ve committed,” CertiK added.

The security firm believes the “rogue developers” are based in Europe, according to an earlier post.

As for the exit scam, CertiK said, “Merlin insiders abused the owner’s wallet privileges,” which is consistent with its initial finding that it came from a private key issue as opposed to an exploit.

Merlin claims the rug pull was carried out by its back-end team, which they claim to have put a “high degree of trust in.”

Related: April’s crypto scams, exploits and hacks lead to $103M lost — CertiK

CertiK, on the other hand, attributed part of the blame to themselves for failing to properly inform users of the centralization risks.

In a note to Cointelegraph, the firm said they would place more emphasis on this in future audit summaries.

“We are working to improve the clarity of our audit summaries in our reports — especially around centralization risks — and to better communicate with the community about the purpose of an audit.”

CertiK however stressed that smart contract auditors shouldn’t be held fully responsible for failing to identify rug pulls:

“Code Audits serve the purpose of uncovering vulnerabilities, not to detect a potential rugpull. Its important to recognize that many projects both large and small have centralization issues flagged, and the vast majority do not result in a rugpull,” the firm said.

The firm launched a $2 million compensation plan to cover the funds lost as a result of the “exit scam” on April 27.

The firm added that the funds pledged will be used to prevent exit scams and assist victims where possible.

With the new TVL figures, Chronos ranks eighth among the largest decentralized exchanges, according to DefiLlama. In DeFi, TVL represents the funds held or staked within a protocol. 

The TVL milestone was achieved during the first hours of the day after the protocol kicked off Epoch 1, which enabled Chronos (CHR) token emissions to liquidity pools. The initiation of Epoch 1 also allowed stakers to begin collecting rewards.

Chronos debuted on April 27 to serve as a liquidity provider and automated market maker for the Arbitrum network, hosting core pools such as Chronos-Ether (CHR/ETH) and Chronos-USD Coin (CHR/USDC), both seeded with 2 million CHR tokens, along with Arbitrum-Ether (ARB/ETH), Ether-USD Coin (ETH/USDC), USD Coin-Tether (USDC/USDT) and Wrapped Bitcoin-Ether (WBTC/ETH) pools.

Decentralized exchanges are at the heart of DeFi and are showing signs of growth and maturity after 2022’s crypto winter. “After [the] FTX bankruptcy, the industry saw the real value of DEXs. Decentralization that DEXs bring matters more than ever,"" noted Charles Wayn, co-founder of Web3 community platform Galxe, explaining that DEXs and wallets will be the backbones of gaming adoption in the coming years.

Likewise, chief technology officer of Maverick Protocol Bob Baxley told Cointelegraph that the past year has served as a proof-of-concept for DEXs and DeFi. “After all, if you look at some major DEXs, on some days they’re doing more volume than Coinbase,"" he said, noting that the tightening regulatory environment in the United States is likely to benefit DEXs:

“If centralized on-ramps into the crypto ecosystem continue to get cut off in places like the United States, then we could see more and more people turning to DEXs for performing their trading.”

DEXs are peer-to-peer marketplaces where crypto traders transact without turning over their funds to intermediaries or custodians. Smart contracts power these self-executing transactions. However, as we’ve seen over the past few years, hacks and bugs are among the biggest risks of trading on DEXs. 

“I suspect volumes for a wide variety of DEXs will eventually grow at an exponential rate, especially when the underlying blockchains like Ethereum continue to scale and, in turn, offer more throughput for lower gas prices,"" Brent Xu, founder of Web3 bond-market platform Umee, told Cointelegraph.

On May 2, WSB was launched by people involved in moderating the WallStreetBets Reddit forum. The subreddit gained notoriety for the GameStop short squeeze, sending hedge funds to their knees in January 2021.

The creators of the WSB token claimed that there would be no allocation for the team and that 10% of the coins would be reserved for the subreddit. The website writes:

“It’s the fairest launch memecoin you will find with no team allocation and no presale. Just a free airdrop and some coins for the community. 10% of the $WSB supply is reserved as a treasury for the r/wallstreetbets sub to do with as they please.”

However, just days later, one of the token’s team members started to dump massive amounts of tokens. On May 4, on-chain detective ZachXBT tweeted that “zjz.eth,” who runs the moderation bots for the subreddit, has allegedly pulled the rug on WSB investors. On-chain data shows that zjz.eth has sold WSB coins in exchange for 334 Ether 

ETH

$1,853

, worth around $635,000 at the time of writing.

The token price dropped massively after the dump, going from an all-time high of $0.00067279 to an all-time low of $0.00004827 in two days. Community members warned people to refrain from buying the dip as the moderators still have access to 10% of the total supply.

Meanwhile, another moderator who goes by WSBmod has threatened to report those who were involved in the dump to the police and the FBI if they don’t reach out. The moderator urged zjz.eth to return the money. 

Cointelegraph tried to reach out to zjz.eth but did not get an immediate response.

Securities token platform INX has launched a wallet with compliance features for institutions, according to a May 3 announcement. The new wallet was created in partnership with wallet infrastructure provider BitGo and uses multi-party computation (MPC) technology.

INX securities tokens exist on the Ethereum network and follow the ERC-1404 token standard. The standard was created in 2018 to allow for compliance-friendly Ethereum tokens. These tokens can only be transferred between users that have passed identity verification with a participating institution.

The new wallet allows institutions to comply with cybersecurity and custody standards in the financial industry when holding INX securities tokens. No single person is given access to the private key that controls a given account. Instead, the key is split into three or more “shards” that have to be combined to sign transactions, which is part of the MPC technology.

According to the announcement, the wallet also contains features to make employee access privileges easier to manage. Companies can task different employees with different roles, such as “viewers, spenders, approvers and administrators.” They can also segregate clients’ assets by splitting up funds into multiple wallets and giving “approver” privileges to each individual client. This allows institutions to give their clients more control over their individual accounts, the announcement said.

Lisa Jowett, head of platform sales at BitGo, said she thinks these new features will help make institutional investors more comfortable using Web3 technology:

“Our wallets can connect to and interact seamlessly with [the INX platform] without compromising on security or reliability. This will unlock new possibilities for investors and serve as a gateway for institutional adoption of Web3.”

INX reached a major milestone on April 3 when it launched its first equity token from a public company, Greenbriar Capital. INX advisor Douglas Borthwick has argued that eventually “all assets will migrate to the blockchain.”

The company is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker-dealer within the United States. Some industry experts have argued that the U.S. doesn’t have clear enough crypto regulations to allow most crypto exchanges to gain this designation.

A new Cosmos-based blockchain called “Tenet'' will use liquid staking coins from other networks to secure its transactions, potentially allowing the new network to inherit the security of older ones, according to a May 3 announcement from the developers.

The network is currently available as a testnet and will launch a mainnet version as soon as testing is complete. This comes after liquid staking has recently become the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol category.

Liquid staking protocols such as Lido, Rocket Pool and Ankr allow users to stake their coins with a network of validators and receive rewards without having to run their own nodes. These protocols also provide users with tokens called “liquid staking derivatives,” or LSDs, redeemable for the underlying deposits and rewards.

According to the announcement, Tenet will allow users to “restake” these LSDs to earn additional rewards on its network. And it will provide users with tokens that represent the LSDs themselves. The team calls these third-order tokens “liquid liquid staking derivatives,” or LLSDs. LLSDs will be usable in lending apps and decentralized exchanges throughout the Tenet network, the announcement said.

The team expects there to be two core benefits to using LSDs instead of a native coin to secure the network. First, it “ensures the long-term security of the Tenet chain by leveraging the joint security of each [layer 1] ecosystem it services.” Second, it should “bring additional liquidity and yield opportunities to LSDs.”

 to be restaked on Tenet.

The new network is being developed by former executives of Ankr and Blockdaemon and is advised by members of the Lido, Ankr and OpenAI teams.

Liquid staking protocols have existed since 2020 when Lido was first launched. They grew in popularity in 2022 and early 2023 as the Ethereum network implemented a move to proof-of-stake and began to allow staking withdrawals. On May 1, crypto analytics platform DefiLlama announced that liquid staking had become the top category of DeFi apps when measured by total value locked.

Some experts have argued that liquid staking may grow in the future as a result of the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade.

“How do we onboard the next billion users into crypto?” This is a question that gets thrown around at crypto conferences and metaverse meetups — one that people have been asking for some time. Reaching mass adoption may sound like a daunting task, but crypto media outlets like Cointelegraph help spread the news of what is going on in the cryptoverse every day, helping increase adoption.

Many people in the crypto space have likely had experiences where others ask them questions about various aspects of cryptocurrency, and trying to cohesively explain all the intricacies in one sitting can be a challenge. This tricky situation is what inspired the latest report from Cointelegraph Research.

Download the report on the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.

The “ABCs of Crypto” report is a perfect start for those new to blockchain, giving a high-level overview of the major cryptocurrencies and blockchains, decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Throughout the report are links and references to all the useful resources found on Cointelegraph’s website. By combining these with other on-chain and statistical data from various sources, “ABCs of Crypto” is meant to be a starting place for those new to the space to learn about everything from why they should care about DeFi to the difference between hot and cold wallets and how NFT marketplaces work.

The world has just begun to adopt blockchain technology

Believe it or not, it took around five decades for electricity to be adopted by nearly 100% of households in the United States. It took the radio around four decades, color televisions took about three, and the internet took almost two decades. The adoption curve of modern technology seems to be getting shorter and shorter. The blockchain industry can be said to have started seeing adoption in the last five to six years. If Metcalfe’s law of exponential network effects spurred on by more users and usage holds true, blockchain may experience an even shorter adoption curve than other technologies of the past century.

DeFi and NFTs are good starting points

Finance and art are two aspects of the human experience that fit perfectly with blockchain, decentralized ledgers and all things crypto. The “ABCs of Crypto” report first focuses on understanding Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,746

, then moves on to other major platforms like Ethereum before discussing decentralized exchanges. It continues on to give readers an introduction to the world of DeFi. Starting with a timeline of NFTs, the report also explores how nonfungible tokens can be used outside of digital art in the form of JPGs — including music, tickets, land and identity.

Cointelegraph Research’s latest report is a starting place to help bring new people into the world of crypto. What better way to become part of the change and put Metcalfe’s law into full effect than by helping at least one or two people hop on board and get comfortable with all that the future of money has to offer?

Blur NFT lending surpasses $16M in loans, led by Machi Big Brother

The milestone comes just one day after the protocol's launch on May 1.

According to data sourced from user @beetle from Dune Dashboard, nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur has facilitated 8,820 Ether, or roughly $16.37 million, in loans through perpetual NFT lending protocol Blend one day after its launch. On May 1, Blur introduced Blend as a novel protocol for pledging NFTs for loans, which was developed in conjunction with venture capital firm Paradigm.

Together, the Azuki, Wrapped CryptoPunks and Milady NFT collections represent the largest collateral, with over 8,000 Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 worth in market value pledged. The top Blur lender, who has issued 58 loans worth 1,180 ETH, is Taiwanese celebrity Jeff Huang, also known as Machi Big Brother.

A prominent figure in Taiwan's music industry, Machi Big Brother is also an avid collector of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT series. Machi was one of the biggest recipients of the Blur token airdrop in February and reportedly sold 1,010 NFTs within 48 hours on Feb. 25 in the ""largest NFT dump ever.""

There are 846 active loans on the platform at the time of publication, with eight refinancing events. As a perpetual lending protocol, Blend automatically extends the duration of loans at expiry, assuming neither the borrowing nor lending party objects. Loans can also be refinanced or held at Dutch auction in case of interest rate changes. Protocol developers claim that Blend charges neither borrowing nor lending fees, but only interest.

PSA

Blur fees by protocol:

Blur Marketplace: 0% fees for traders

Blur Lending (Blend): 0% fees for borrowers and lenders

Note that borrowers still pay interest on loans based on what lenders offer. 100% of that goes to the lender.

— Blur (@blur_io) May 2, 2023

Last year, NFT lending protocols fell into disarray after a crypto bear market caused many collectibles to become illiquid, some of which had no bids at all. One protocol, BendDAO, had as little as $23,715 to pay back lenders at the time after facilitating more than 15,000 ETH in loans.

Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit is the latest major platform to roll out an in-house cryptocurrency lending service for users.

The Dubai-based exchange announced the service’s launch on May 2, delivering interest payouts to users that deposit cryptocurrency through the platform’s new offering. The service is touted to payout hourly interest payments from lending pools, while lenders can deposit and redeem loaned cryptocurrency tokens without lock-up periods.

Meanwhile, borrowers on Bybit’s exchange can take out loans to tap into funds for various trading options on the platform. Borrowers must post an equal or greater amount of collateral assets in relation to the loan amount to safeguard lenders’ investments.

A statement from Bybit CEO and co-founder Ben Zhou outlined the crypto exchange’s intent to offer users a means to generate returns. Advanced traders can access capital from lenders for more advanced trading options on the exchange.

Bybit is the latest major cryptocurrency exchange to offer a cryptocurrency lending service. Binance provides a handful of services that allow users to earn interest on deposited cryptocurrency assets.

KuCoin also offers a lending service on a wide variety of tokens. OKX offers users a loan facility that enables them to borrow funds on deposited tokens but does not facilitate user lending on its exchange platform.

Related: DeFi transforming lending routes on the blockchain

United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase abandoned plans to launch its own lending service in September 2021 following a stern warning from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The U.S. regulator had deemed the offering a security, with Coinbase promising 4% annual returns on USD Coin

 deposits.

Kraken also fell foul of overstepping regulatory boundaries in the U.S., which eventually led to a $30 million settlement with the SEC over the operation of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program in February 2023.

While just a handful of major cryptocurrency exchanges offer bespoke lending services, the decentralized finance (DeFi) space presents a myriad of avenues for cryptocurrency users to earn interest on loaned digital assets.

Meanwhile, according to data from Binance chain explorer BSC Scan, the v2 controller contract shows multiple calls of the “claim multiple” function over the past 48 hours.

At the time of writing, the implementation of the contract does not appear to have been altered since the advent of the attack; however, Level Finance said that it would deploy a new implementation of the referral contract within the next 12 hours.

The exchange also noted that its liquidity pools and related DAOs remain unaffected by the attack.

Liquid staking solutions such as Lido and Rocket Pool now have more total value locked (TVL) than decentralized exchanges (DEXs), making them the top category of DeFi protocols, according to data from crypto analytics platform DefiLlama.

For the first time, the Liquid Staking category has surpassed DEXes in total value locked, making it the leading category in DeFi by TVL dominance pic.twitter.com/HQ0Ug8UweR

— DefiLlama.com (@DefiLlama) April 26, 2023

TVL is a metric that measures the dollar value of all cryptocurrencies locked within a protocol’s smart contracts.

Liquid staking protocols have just recently taken the top spot. On April 13, there was only $17.19 billion of crypto locked in liquid staking contracts, compared to $18.89 billion in DEXs, according to archived information. However, DEXs have experienced a $1.66 billion decline to $17.2 billion, while liquid staking solutions have experienced a $280 million increase to $17.47 billion, giving them the top spot.

Related: Podcaster apologizes for spreading Lido rumor

Liquid staking protocols are staking pools that stake crypto on behalf of users. These protocols also issue tokens to users that represent the person's deposited crypto. Because these tokens can be used in DeFi apps, liquid staking protocols allow users to both simultaneously stake their coins and use them in other applications.

According to DefiLlama’s May 1 data, Lido (stETH) is still the top staking protocol with $11.54 billion of cryptocurrency locked inside its contracts. Coinbase Wrapped Staked Ether (CBETH) is a distant second with $2.19 billion locked, and Rocket Pool (rETH) is third with $1.46 billion. The remaining protocols have less than $1 billion of TVL each but add up to $2.22 billion collectively.

Lido was the first liquid staking protocol, and it launched in 2020. Liquid staking has become more popular as Ethereum moved to proof-of-stake and allowed withdrawals.

Crypto exploits, exit scams and flash loan attacks saw little signs of letting up in April, with more than $103 million of funds stolen from crypto projects and investors in the month.

On April 30, crypto security and auditing firm CertiK posted an April roundup of crypto exploits, scams and hacks, revealing total funds lost in April was $103.7 million, bringing the total year-to-date loss to $429.7 million.

The month was particularly marred with major crypto exploits, such as $25.4 million lost due to an exploit of several MEV trading bots on April 3, $22 million stolen in a hot wallet exploit at the Bitrue exchange and the hack of South Korean GDAC exchange leading to a loss of $13 million.

The total lost to crypto and DeFi exploits in the month amounted to $74.5 million, making up around half of the total $145 million exploited in the first four months of the year, according to CertiK.

The month also saw around $20 million lost to flash loan attacks, led mainly by Yearn Finance after a hacker exploited an old smart contract on April 13.

The blockchain security firm noted that total funds lost to exit scams reached $9.4 million in the month, with the top exit scam for the month being Merlin DEX, which lost $2.7 million. On April 26, CertiK reported that it was investigating a “potential private key management issue” at the exchange.

Furthermore, the exit scam occurred after the protocol was audited by CertiK, which warned about centralization issues. CertiK launched a compensation plan following the attack in which it urged the rogue developer to return 80% of the stolen funds with a 20% white hat bounty offered.

According to De.Fi’s Rekt Database, there were over 50 crypto exploits, scams, hacks and rug pulls in April. Moreover, a large portion of them was memecoin rug pulls.

The most recent was the Polygon-based Ovix protocol, which lost $2 million in a flash loan attack on April 28.

 issuer Circle launched a cross-chain USDC transfer protocol between Ethereum and Avalanche.

Ordinals Finance, an Ethereum-based DeFi protocol, allegedly rug-pulled its users for over a million dollars and erased its presence from all social media platforms as news about the same broke out.

The top 100 DeFi tokens by market capitalization had another mixed week in terms of price action, with minimal changes over the past week.

UK Treasury seeks input on taxing DeFi staking and lending

The taxation arm of the UK Treasury is seeking input on a possible new regime for taxing DeFi. An April 27 consultation by His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs will run until June 22. It asks for “investors, professionals and firms engaged in DeFi activities” along with representative bodies and think tanks to submit their views on the government’s proposed DeFi tax treatment.

Under the proposed legislative changes, crypto used in DeFi transactions wouldn’t be treated as a disposal for the purposes of tax, which usually trigger a capital gains tax event.

DeFi options protocol raises $17M for buy-side marketplace

Thetanuts Finance, a DeFi protocol offering crypto options contracts, has raised $17 million to provide a buy-side marketplace and an expanded list of coins, according to an April 24 announcement from the team.

The team plans to employ the new funds to provide a “buy-side altcoin options market” to attract options purchasers. The announcement states that, until now, DeFi options protocols have focused on attracting sellers looking for steady income instead of options traders looking for leverage. Using the newly raised funds, the developers hope to be one of the first protocols to provide products for the buy side of the options market.

Circle launches cross-chain USDC transfer protocol for Ethereum, Avalanche

Circle, the creator of USDC, has launched a mainnet protocol that lets users transfer USDC between Ethereum and Avalanche, according to an April 26 announcement. Previously, Avalanche users holding USDC on Ethereum had to deposit their coins with a Circle partner or use a third-party bridge to transfer USDC between networks. The new cross-chain transfer protocol appears to do away with the need for USDC bridges.

The team released a video on April 13 showing how the new protocol works. Unlike a traditional bridge, it doesn’t lock tokens sent to its contract. Instead, it destroys them and issues new tokens on the receiving network. Users can directly redeem these new tokens for bank deposits by depositing them with Circle or its partners.

Ordinals Finance has conducted a $1M rug pull: CertiK

Ordinals Finance, an Ethereum-based DeFi protocol that allows users to lend and borrow inscriptions, has been accused of performing an exit scam known as a “rug pull.”

In an April 24 press release seen by Cointelegraph, blockchain security firm CertiK reported that the protocol’s developer pulled 256 million of its native OFI tokens out of its smart contracts using a “safuToken” function. Another 13 million OFI were removed through an “ownerRewithdraw” function, bringing the total number of tokens withdrawn to 269 million, CertiK stated.

The tax treatment of lending and borrowing on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols could soon be changed in the United Kingdom, as the taxation arm of the Treasury is seeking input on a possible new regime.

An April 27 consultation by HM Revenue and Customs will run until June 22 and asks for “investors, professionals and firms engaged in DeFi activities” along with representative bodies and think tanks to submit their views on the government's proposed DeFi tax treatment.

Under the proposed legislative changes, crypto used in DeFi transactions wouldn’t be treated as a disposal for the purposes of tax, which usually trigger a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) event.

Instead, CGT would apply — and a taxable event would occur — when cryptocurrencies are disposed of in a non-DeFi transaction.

According to the consultation, a transaction must meet certain criteria to be considered a DeFi transaction.

Specifically, it should involve the initial transfer of crypto assets from a lender to a borrower, or through a smart contract, with the borrower being obligated to return the tokens.

HMRC Update on DeFi Guidance

I will take time to digest. But here are some pieces:

1. Clear preference to options
2. They agree it needs to be changed
3. Another call for evidence #crypto #tax #accounting #hmrc https://t.co/O6VrTxNUCk

— Jme - UK Crypto Accountant (@CryptoTaxJme) April 27, 2023

Additionally, the lender should have the right to withdraw the same amount of tokens that were initially lent or staked.

The aim of the consultation is to establish a framework that “better aligns” the taxation of cryptocurrency assets used in DeFi lending and staking transactions while making it easier for users to comply with the regulations. It noted:

“To reduce the administrative burden for participants, the new tax framework could treat all DeFi returns as being revenue in nature and charged to a new miscellaneous income charge specific for cryptoasset transactions.”

The consultation is the second stage of a five-step process, which will be followed by drafting legislation, implementing and monitoring, and ultimately, reviewing and evaluating the change.

The British government took the first step in the process in July by soliciting feedback on the taxation of crypto asset loans and staking within the context of DeFi. 

Simplifying the administrative process was again noted as the main objective as well as reducing costs for taxpayers participating in DeFi while also exploring how the tax treatment could better reflect the economic substance of these transactions.

Data from Google Ads coupled with blockchain analytics reveals that over $4 million has been stolen from users that have fallen for malicious phishing websites promoted on Google.

According to Web3 anti-scam service provider ScamSniffer, malicious adverts for phishing websites have been prevalent on Google ads searches in recent weeks. The URLs lead to fraudulent websites that prompt wallet login signature requests that compromise users’ addresses.

1/ A recent surge in phishing scams via Google search ads has led to users losing approximately $4 million.
ScamSniffer has investigated multiple cases where users clicked on malicious ads and were directed to fraudulent websites.#PhishingScams #GoogleAds pic.twitter.com/vuKCgSuFnV

— Scam Sniffer (@realScamSniffer) April 27, 2023

A number of decentralized finance protocols, websites and brands, including Zapper.fi, Lido, Stargate, DefiLlama, Orbiter Finance and Radiant, have been targeted by scammers. Slight changes to official URLs make it difficult for users to identify that they’ve clicked on malicious links.

Analysis of metadata from a number of the phishing websites in question has been linked to advertisers located in Ukraine and Canada. The users responsible for placing the malicious adverts make use of a number of methods to bypass Google’s ad review process. This includes manipulating the Google Click ID parameter, which allows the attackers to show a normal webpage during Google’s ad review.

Other malicious adverts use anti-debugging methods to redirect users with developer tools enabled to a normal website, while a direct click takes users to the malicious website. This also allows scammers to bypass some of Google ads’ machine reviews.

On-chain data analysis from addresses linked to malicious websites advertised on Google from ScamSniffer’s database suggests that $4.16 million has been stolen from over 3,000 users over the past month.

The anti-scam service followed on-chain flows of funds to various exchange and mixing services, including SimpleSwap, Tornado Cash, KuCoin and Binance.

Making use of advertising analysis platforms, ScamSniffer suggests that the cost of promoting crypto-related phishing websites is lucrative. The average cost per click for associated keywords is between $1 to $2.

Estimating a conversion rate of 40% from 7,500 users clicking on malicious adverts, scammers have spent around $15,000 on advertising which has provided a return on their malevolent investments of 276%, given the $4 million stolen to date.

A report from Russian cybersecurity and anti-virus provider Kaspersky highlighted an increase in crypto-related phishing attacks through 2022, up 40% year on year, with over 5 million phishing attacks identified last year.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), led by Chairman Gary Gensler, has been at the forefront of the United States' cryptocurrency crackdown. In the last few months, the agency has filed several enforcement actions against major crypto companies that allegedly violated security laws.

Critics say the agency has adopted a regulation-by-enforcement approach without providing a proper set of rules that fit the unique features of crypto assets. A major source of confusion is the definition of a security and whether it can apply to a highly diverse set of assets such as cryptocurrencies. 

Despite being pressured in a congressional hearing last week, Gensler seems unwilling to take on the political responsibility of entering a constructive dialogue with the industry. 

For many crypto companies targeted by the SEC, the choice is between entering an expensive legal battle with the regulator or shutting down operations in the US and moving overseas. Most crypto companies will likely prefer saving millions of dollars in legal expenses and opt for the latter option.

Circle, the creator of US Dollar Coin 

USDC

$1.00

, has launched a mainnet protocol that lets users transfer USDC between Ethereum and Avalanche, according to an April 26 announcement. Previously, Avalanche users who held USDC on Ethereum had to deposit their coins with a Circle partner or use a third-party bridge to transfer their USDC from one network to the other. The new Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) protocol appears to do away with this need for USDC bridges.

The team released a video on April 13 showing how the new protocol works. Unlike a traditional bridge, it doesn’t lock tokens sent to its contract. Instead, it completely destroys them and issues new tokens on the receiving network. Users can redeem these new tokens for bank deposits directly, by depositing the tokens with Circle or its partners.

In the announcement, the team said that it expects CCTP to solve the problem of “fragmentation” in the Web3 ecosystem. Currently, there are multiple unofficial versions of USDC floating around on various networks, most of which are the result of tokens on one network being bridged to another. Now that there is an official way to transfer coins from one network to another, the team expects these unofficial copies to slowly decline in use, making the token less confusing to use.

The team said that many of the largest cross-chain protocols have already pledged to use CCTP going forward, including Celer, Hyperlane, LayerZero, LI.FI, MetaMask, Wormhole and others.

Related: VISA will facilitate USDC payments, thanks to fresh partnership

Joao Reginatto, Circle’s vice president of product, said he believes the new protocol will help improve liquidity and capital efficiency in decentralized finance:

“With CCTP, developers can simplify the user experience and their users can trust that they are always transacting with a highly liquid, safe and fungible asset in native USDC.""

USDC is a fiat-backed stablecoin issued by Circle. The company claims that each USDC token is backed dollar-for-dollar in its reserves. Users can mint USDC by opening an account and depositing cash with either Circle itself or one of its partners, such as Coinbase. Once they’ve done this, they can receive the coin on several networks, including Ethereum, Avalanche, Stellar and Polkadot.

Users have lost billions of dollars worth of USDC and other cryptocurrencies due to bridge hacks over the past few years, as attackers have repeatedly figured out how to remove locked coins from bridge contracts and leave their copies on the receiving network with no backing. This has left developers wondering how to secure bridges for future use as digital assets become more mainstream.

In the mid-2010s, the Islamic State was rapidly advancing through Iraq and Syria, conquering territory and terrifying residents. However, one group of Kurds in Northern Syria representing the de facto autonomous Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, in an area known as Rojava, successfully fought back the Islamic State and captured the attention of the world.

Many people from around the world went to Rojava to fight, but one lesser-known story made ripples in the crypto world: Some volunteers traveled there to help build blockchain and technological literacy and experiment with the potential of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,734

 to serve as a tool for revolutionary change. After all, Rojava promotes decentralization, autonomy and self-empowerment — sound familiar?

On Episode 10 of The Agenda, hosts Ray Salmond and Jonathan DeYoung were joined by DarkFi co-founder Rachel Rose-O’Leary and community member Kato, who discussed their work volunteering in Rojava and how those experiences inspired and relate to their current involvement in DarkFi, an anonymous blockchain protocol.

Rojava’s blockchain and crypto experiment

O’Leary traveled to Rojava in late 2018 after feeling disillusioned with the crypto space and how far it had seemingly strayed from its early cypherpunk roots. “I was convinced at that time that Rojava was a place where the ideals of crypto were being fielded and tested,” she said. O’Leary was inspired by Amir Taaki, an early Bitcoin pioneer who himself traveled to the region to volunteer.

Meanwhile, Kato first discovered crypto while already in Rojava. “I basically got interested in crypto and in privacy technologies because of the actual need of the people,” he shared. “I saw the actual use cases, and a lot of people at that time already around the world started using crypto for practical means, like for sending money around.”

“If you don’t have a working banking system or you don’t have access, which is true for most of the world, it’s much more efficient. And also especially if you’re facing persecution and political oppression. And often, it’s actually the only way that you have.”

O’Leary spent much of her time “volunteering very much with building educational infrastructure, especially in terms of technology” — including introducing people to crypto and blockchain. “It’s a very interesting environment for crypto because of the fact that there are no banks,” she shared. “Also, there is no state. So, cryptocurrency is a really interesting like financial paradigm for that kind of a context.”

Related: ‘Privacy has become a taboo,’ says crypto-anarchist project DarkFi

When asked about whether crypto education is continuing in Rojava in 2023, Kato responded, “There are technical academies and education centers in Rojava, and even new ones have been opened over the last years.” However, the work remains difficult, as “the war is a huge pressure, not just on technical education but on all social fields.”

Privacy is paramount

O’Leary went on to co-found DarkFi, an anonymous layer-1 blockchain protocol of which Kato is also an active community member. For O’Leary, privacy is essential for the ability of communities to operate freely and autonomously, and the anonymity provided by encryption represents a 21st-century tool for people to express themselves fully:

“If people are under constant surveillance and monitoring by an enormous surveillance apparatus and a surveillance state, then they’re being prohibited from exercising [...] their moral and political society.”

When asked about the future of privacy and whether it’s possible to break free from the mass surveillance paradigm, Kato said that “we’re going to have that struggle for a long time, and for much longer than decades,” adding: “It’s maybe the most fundamental struggle of human society.”

But is there light at the end of the tunnel? Kato believes that through decentralized tools like blockchain, “we have this technology to be able to develop our own financial and economic systems that are actually democratically managed by the people who use them according to what they actually need.”

“There are moments in history where technology reconfigures the nature of power, and the printing press is a very common example,” added O’Leary. “I think we have a similar situation now happening in cryptocurrency, where it’s hard to see now because we’re just at the onset of it. But the basis of power is in the process of being reconfigured by virtue of these technologies.”

UK pledges nearly $125M to create ‘safe AI’ taskforce

The British government has pledged 100 million British pounds ($124.8 million) in funding to support a task force for the development of “safe AI.”

The United Kingdom is buckling down on its efforts to ramp up the country’s technology sector. Officials released an announcement for funding of a new artificial intelligence (AI) task force. 

According to the announcement on April 25, the U.K. prime minister and technology secretary will be doling out 100 million British pounds ($124.8 million) in initial funding to support a task force that will accelerate the country’s AI readiness.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that AI provides many opportunities for economic growth and advancements in healthcare and security.

“By investing in emerging technologies through our new expert taskforce, we can continue to lead the way in developing safe and trustworthy AI as part of shaping a more innovative UK economy.”

The task force is set to “ensure sovereign capabilities,” which include public services, along with fostering broad adoption of “safe and reliable foundation models.” This coincides with the UK’s commitment to becoming a science and technology superpower by 2030.

According to the announcement, the first pilots of AI usage and integration will target public services and are expected to launch in the next upcoming six months. Legislators in the U.K. have already designed an investment of 900 pounds ($1.1 billion) into computing technology.

Officials in the U.K are simultaneously pushing for “safe AI,” which means regulating the technology to “keep people safe” without limiting innovation. 

Michelle Donelan, the country’s science, innovation and technology secretary, said that if “developed responsibly,” AI can transform every industry.

“This will ensure that the public and business have the trust they need to confidently adopt this technology and fully realize its benefits.”

This development comes shortly after the U.K. Treasury decided to resurrect its Asset Management Taskforce with a renewed focus on developing crypto regulation. The news included that Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, would help advise regulators on law and taxation between banks and the fintech industry.

In recent years, both the crypto space and the gaming industry have been slowly merging together with the steady development of game finance (GameFi) and play-to-earn (P2E) models.

The future of GameFi

Initially coined by Yearn.finance (YFI) founder Andre Conje, GameFi refers to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols with gamified elements. However, the phrase has evolved to encompass the financial aspects of blockchain games due to their inherent connection to real-world economies.

In other words, GameFi allows gamers to play and earn cryptocurrency through various in-game activities such as battles, crafting and quests. By leveraging blockchain technology, GameFi can enable true ownership of in-game assets, allowing players to buy, sell and trade them as they would real-world assets.

However, recent industry reports have indicated a gradual decline in the growth and adoption of the GameFi industry. An analytics report released by Messari Crypto in February 2023 revealed that the number of active GameFi users steadily declined by 34% since October 2022, with average monthly signups decreasing month-on-month.

As a result, these developments have led some experts and stakeholders to question the feasibility of GameFi’s potential to drive mass adoption of cryptocurrency as was once believed.

Despite this, there is still hope for GameFi’s revival as it slowly evolves and continues to leverage elements of traditional gaming to address some of the crucial challenges it is facing.

Gameplay matters

A significant challenge to the adoption of GameFi is the need for more emphasis on gameplay. To achieve mass adoption, GameFi developers should prioritize creating a project that not only provides real-world value and utility for in-game assets but also keeps players engaged continuously. Developing a sustainable blockchain game requires building a project that has the potential to maintain a recurring player base.

Accessibility matters more

Arguably, the most significant barrier to the adoption of GameFi is the lack of accessibility for mainstream users. This is due to a number of factors, including the complexities associated with cryptocurrencies, such as the use of wallet addresses and private keys.

For those new to the crypto world, the concept of wallet addresses and private keys can be complex and uninviting. Wallet addresses are long strings of alphanumeric characters that are unique to each user and are used to send and receive cryptocurrency. Using public keys as unique addresses can make them difficult for people to read, increasing the likelihood of errors. As a result, access to GameFi has been limited to those with prior knowledge and experience in the crypto world, rather than the general public.

The answer lies in identity

One potential solution to the complexity of wallet addresses is to implement a universal digital identifier such as a digital identity that can serve as both a wallet address and a username. In traditional gaming, players often use screen names or usernames to identify themselves within a gaming ecosystem.

Similarly, a universal identifier could serve as a gamer’s digital identity in GameFi. This would allow a gamer to not only use it as their public persona but also as a way to simplify the process of claiming rewards without the need for long and complicated strings of alphanumeric characters. This approach could make GameFi accessible to mainstream users unfamiliar with cryptocurrency intricacies.

Added bonus

In addition, the introduction of a universal identifier in GameFi can enable the creation of monetized reputation systems within gaming ecosystems that promote good behavior within communities. Reputation systems can incentivize positive contributions such as helping new players, contributing to game development and participating in governance, thereby promoting a healthy gaming culture.

Furthermore, this universal identifier could enable cross-game interoperability, allowing players to easily use their digital identity across games and platforms. This development can create a more connected and dynamic gaming ecosystem, leading to increased engagement and adoption of GameFi that will incentivize gamers to remain active users across multiple ecosystems.

A new era for GameFi?

While GameFi has shown promise since its inception, it still has a long way to go. The implementation of a universal digital identifier will not only help GameFi gain traction but also has the potential to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 gaming projects. Simplifying the complex process of claiming rewards in parallel with world-class gameplay and cross-game interoperability would undoubtedly open the floodgates of mass adoption. Thus, the key to unlocking mass adoption lies in the creation of a universal identifier that will propel GameFi to increasing prominence and success.

With the continued evolution of GameFi and the adoption of user-centric solutions such as universal digital identifiers, the gaming industry could see a significant shift in the coming years, paving the way for a new era of blockchain gaming, with the industry shedding its hype and emerging as a serious contender for mass adoption of crypto as a whole.

Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are accompanied by a wide range of evolving technologies that are facilitated by the rise of the internet. Edge computing, a distributed computing paradigm that enables processing data far away from a data center or cloud at the “edge” of the network, counts among them.

Edge computing, a key technology of the Metaverse, alleviates latency by processing data closer to the source, thus significantly reducing the time it takes for data to travel to and from a server. By bringing computing power and data storage closer to the location where it’s needed, edge computing has the potential to save bandwidth while resulting in better response times. Processing data locally also ensures that applications continue to run as intended even when there is a network outage.

The potential use cases of processing data at the edge of the network created an available market of $11 billion in 2022. From healthcare to manufacturing to agriculture and to gaming, the edge-computing market is growing at a CAGR of 37.9%, according to Grand View Research, with a $155.9 billion total available market forecasted for 2030.

As edge computing continues growing at a fast rate along with the availability of better internet connectivity, projects have started looking for ways to benefit from blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies to provide users and businesses with new ways to monetize their internet availability.

Powered by high-speed Wi-Fi devices, the RevoFi network is a decentralized wireless infrastructure platform aimed at delivering a simplistic approach to onboarding for nonfungible tokens (NFTs), crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi). RevoFi aims to democratize and decentralize the internet with AI capabilities, flexible business models, reduction in cloud costs and versatile revenue generation. Its far-edge computing segment can potentially represent a serviceable, obtainable market of $1.1 billion in 2023 and $14.5 billion in 2030.

A decentralized network created for users

Users can join the network by owning a RevoFi-enabled device and earn Revos (RVS), the native token of the blockchain, by providing network coverage and sharing resources to compute, store and send data across the network. Deemed the next generation of wireless technologies, the Wi-Fi 6 mesh connectivity used in RevoFi devices provides significantly faster connections across a group of devices, establishing a reliable hardware infrastructure for the Revos blockchain.

Blockchain for a better society: How to reach beyond financial inclusivity

The world needs innovation to hit the Sustainable Development Goals set by the UN in time, and blockchain is here to help.

The COVID-19 pandemic has erased more than four years of progress in the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While philanthropy is seen as a key contributor to getting the international development agenda back on track, it is plagued by a lack of transparency — a drawback that can be solved by technology.

Introduced in 2015 by the UN, the 17 SDGs range from poverty eradication to clean water and sanitation with a goal of transforming the planet for the better by 2030. Social giving is a critical enabler in using the wealth of the globe to increase the quality of life in the least-developed countries. However, the legacy systems used by charities beg for more transparency, efficiency and accountability — with the latter also being highlighted by the UN as a significant challenge standing before the SDGs.

Blockchain for a better world

Blockchain technology stands as a solution to the need for a traceable and immutable infrastructure for philanthropy, but the traditional proof-of-work (PoW) consensus used by the Bitcoin blockchain often comes under fire for its energy consumption. The Fruits Eco-Blockchain, a project that aims to create an eco-friendly and sustainable economy open to everyone, instead uses a proof-of-capacity (PoC) algorithm to address blockchain’s issue of high gas fees and energy consumption.

The FRUITS PoC algorithm provides extremely low energy consumption, high security, high-speed transaction, high versatility and no transaction costs. It uses a random draw method for mining, eliminating unnecessary time and power consumption. The multi-layered smart contracts found in the Fruits blockchain are designed for a wide variety of uses, helping with different philanthropic goals. Combined with blockchain’s inherent ability for financial traceability and transparency, it becomes the ideal infrastructure for global charity efforts.

Incentivizing charity with blockchain

When a user spends Fruits coins (FRTS), the native token of the Fruits Eco-Blockchain, the transaction generates a Smile Coin as a sign of gratitude. Smile Coins, also known as the ""donation coin” of the platform, can be spent on their charity website (Fruits SDGs Station) to help accelerate the listed SDGs, ranging from providing clean water and sanitation to children in Mali, West Africa, to providing quality education to children in Afghanistan.

The team established regional bases named Fruits SDGs Stations in underdeveloped countries in accordance with each region’s climate, culture and characteristics to provide direct help to people in need. In order to incentivize charity, users are automatically granted Thanks Fruits Seed Tokens (TFSTs) following their Smile Coin donation to a Fruits SDGs Station. Each TFST will hold different meanings. As an example, one TFST may act as a lottery token, giving the contributor back more FRTS than before. Users will also earn Smile Coins when they make a transaction on the NFT marketplace, getting another chance to donate and receive Seed Tokens.

To encourage financial inclusivity and support charities, the Fruits Eco-Blockchain Project plans to launch its digital money transfer network, the FRUITS Social Finance Platform, with a financial transaction-focused crypto exchange and charity crowdfunding platform. The team also aims to issue gold-pegged stablecoins, gold ingot NFTs, and build out their NFT marketplace.

Blockchain has the potential to act as the gateway to a better society. Its immutability, transparency and scalability enable a wide range of use cases beyond financial inclusivity. Tailoring the fundamental functions of blockchain for specific scenarios, like using a PoC algorithm for an eco-friendly infrastructure, would help with making it the ideal solution to solve major challenges that currently hinder the completion of the international sustainability agenda.

Japan’s regulatory and political environment for crypto and Web3 technologies has been evolving rapidly over the past several years. The Financial Services Agency of Japan reported in December 2022 it planned to lift restrictions on foreign-issued stablecoins in Japanese exchanges, which could have significant implications for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem in Japan and the wider region.

Furthermore, the Japanese government’s announcement that it plans to invest in nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and the metaverse highlights the increasing recognition of the potential of Web3 technologies to transform various sectors of society and the economy.

On the backdrop of these significant strides for blockchain and cryptocurrency, industry insiders from around the world gathered at the historic Kanda Myojin Shrine in Tokyo for DAO Tokyo 2023, a conference focused on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and organized by Fracton Ventures.

The lineup of keynote speakers spanned various sectors of the DAO ecosystem, including ENS DAO, which manages the Ethereum Name Service; Shibuya, a decentralized social media platform; the dYdX Foundation, an independent foundation dedicated to decentralized exchange dYdX; and more.

Traditions meet decentralized tech

Speakers discussed the importance of DAOs as a new paradigm for organizational governance and decision-making and their potential to transform the art world, promote decentralized creativity and empower local businesses and residents.

DAO Tokyo featured numerous panel discussions where participants discussed the importance of creating decentralized systems that prioritize user privacy and control, and the potential for Web3 to enable new forms of value creation and monetization.

The panelists also discussed the potential of blockchain technology to enable new forms of trust and collaboration, particularly in industries such as finance and supply chain management. They highlighted the potential for DeFi to transform the financial industry and the challenges of regulatory compliance.

In addition to the insightful panel discussions and keynote speeches, the DAO Tokyo conference also featured a range of other activities that highlighted the potential of decentralized tech, including a campaign to mint Kanda Myojin augmented reality NFTs designed to commemorate the conference.

ENS DAO created and distributed “ENS Cards” with near-field communication (NFC) capability to about 120 preregistered event participants. These NFC-enabled “business cards” for the Web3 era served as NFT badges proving participants had met, a function enabled by tapping the card on one’s smartphone.

It was interesting to watch how at this global event — with 90% of the audience being from outside Japan — the only people exchanging physical business cards were Japanese, symbolizing how the most recent trends come to Japan later than the rest of the globe and highlighting how Japanese society respects its traditions.

When asked why he wanted to participate in the event, Makoto Inoue, a core developer at Ethereum Name Service, noted that ENS was impressed by the vitality of the community at the previous DAO NYC event in New York and wanted to contribute to the success of the first full-fledged DAO event in Asia by sponsoring it.

He also highlighted the potential of DAOs to manage projects such as DeFi and NFTs and said that he hoped more tools would emerge to make participation easier. Inoue noted that the cryptocurrency industry is going through a winter season, but this is an opportunity for new projects to emerge.

Jocelyn Chang, Asia-Pacific growth lead at MakerDAO, told Cointelegraph, “Asia, with many innovative projects and initiatives in the space, has a unique opportunity to play a leading role in shaping the future of DAOs. Participating in a DAO conference in Asia is an important step in promoting adoption, collaboration, diversity and innovation in the development of DAOs in the region.”

Patrick Rawson, co-founder of Curve Labs, told Cointelegraph that the dominance of Western DAOs is set to change as Asia gains momentum in the Web3 space. He said that Asia would become increasingly involved in the Web3 space as Western jurisdictions like the United States face regulatory challenges and Asian developers become increasingly involved in the blockchain and crypto industries.

What’s next?

DAO Tokyo was a reminder of the energy and creativity driving the Web3 industry forward and of Japan’s position at the forefront of this new frontier. With a growing ecosystem of blockchain startups, investors and enthusiasts, Japan is poised to become a major player in the Web3 world.

The Japan Business Federation — also known as Keidanren — recently made a proposal that aims to make Japan a leading Web3 advanced country by 2025 by addressing various issues, such as decentralized data ownership, governance transformation and innovation in various industries.

Recent: The gamble of crypto airdrop hunting and what it means for blockchain devs

Keidanren listed three areas Japan could address to become a Web3 advanced country: appropriate tax measures for token ownership, revision of the law on investment business limited liability partnership agreements, and appropriate operation of the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association audit. The federation also proposed measures for NFTs, DAOs and the metaverse.

Japan will host several more large-scale Web3-focused conferences this summer, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida already confirmed as a speaker at some.

In the crypto space, the term “airdrop” refers to the unsolicited distribution of tokens, usually for marketing purposes or as a reward for network participation or contributions.

The first recorded crypto airdrop took place back in 2014 when Auroracoin handed out its native cryptocurrency, AUR.

Another well-known airdrop was that of decentralized exchange Uniswap, which gave its UNI 

UNI

$4.99

 governance token to its users in 2020. In total, over 250,000 accounts received 400 UNI each.

While airdrops may have encouraged some to be more active on blockchain networks, Chris Bradbury, CEO of decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Oasis.app, told Cointelegraph that users have realized how airdrops can be exploited, which has led to the phenomenon of “airdrop hunting.”

Airdrop hunters aim to make money by farming tokens from airdrops, hoping they will become valuable.

One recent example occurred during Arbitrum’s ARB airdrop, with on-chain activity revealing that airdrop hunters consolidated $3.3 million worth of ARB from 1,496 wallets into just two.

We found 2 super airdrop hunters of $ARB.

According to blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain, one wallet received 1.4 million ARB from 866 addresses, worth around $2 million at the time, while another wallet received 933,375 ARB from 630 addresses, worth around $1.38 million.

On March 20, Lookonchain revealed that six specific airdrop hunters had gotten nearly every massive airdrop in crypto.

Bradbury told Cointelegraph that “pro airdrop hunters will use scripts” to consolidate many different addresses into only a handful. “We’re not talking here about someone with thousands of wallets; these will be sophisticated developers to perform multiple actions across many wallets all programmatically,” he said.

A dangerous game

Bradbury further noted that while the tactic has the potential to be profitable once the costs and time involved are subtracted, it comes with some serious financial risks.

“Airdrop hunting is effectively a game,” he said, stating that it requires finding protocols that have not released a token, then interacting with them in all the various ways that could qualify the hunter to earn a portion of the airdrop.

Bradbury added that the risks are even higher when the protocols are new or unproven:

“The nature of retroactive airdrops means you’re often using new protocols, ones that haven’t stood the test of time. And in most cases, you have to deposit your assets into these protocols, adding risk that you could lose your assets to bugs or hacks.”

“The cost of airdrop hunting can quickly outweigh the value of any airdrop if it doesn’t become a top-tier protocol,” he added.

Failing to consider gas fees and other financial costs can also prove to be an issue for hunters.

How many of you missed Aptos #airdrop ? How many missed Arbitrum? Missed DyDx, Blur, Space ID etc.. ?

Airdrop hunting is not an exact science.
We spend many hours, we hope, we get discouraged, we do not see rewards coming, then when it falls, the result is always the same :

Bradbury said it can wind up being tricky to find and complete the tasks required to earn a potential airdrop, as protocols are coming up with more innovative criteria.

“It can lead to losses if you end up doing a lot of things that don’t qualify, and most protocols now try to come up with innovative ways of deciding who gets an allocation — so the chance of spending time and money on something that doesn’t count is getting higher,” Bradbury said.

“You ultimately have to use the protocols, hoping to ‘win’ by performing the right actions on the right protocols but not really knowing exactly what you have to do — like a game,” he added.

Consequences of airdrop hunting

Airdrop hunting has become a relatively common practice in crypto as individuals and groups seek opportunities to receive free tokens and make a profit.

Crypto Twitter has many users offering tips on the best ways to airdrop hunt, sharing protocols that might provide a chance to make a profit and swapping other airdrop-related advice.

Some platforms, such as DeFi analytics platform DefiLlama, even have a page showing projects that don’t yet have a token but might in the future.

Zoe Wei, head of developer relations and marketing at BNB Chain, told Cointelegraph the extent of airdrop hunting can vary depending on the specific airdrop and the measures taken by the project team to mitigate the activity.

She also noted that the practice could create long-term problems for protocols when trying to provide incentives for ecosystem builders and contributors, which are crucial for long-term growth.

“Airdrops are important for the growth of a community from an early stage, but the difficulty lies when identifying the contributors — distinguishing between the real contributors and those who only contribute to get a reward,” Wei said.

According to Bradbury, a protocol’s long-term health is attached to rewarding real users and contributors who are there to help. Failing to recognize this can lead to an exodus as users look for other projects.

“This idea that there might be a generous airdrop and monetary value for using the protocol is actually how protocols get early users and the initial liquidity that they need,” he said.

However, Bradbury added, “The biggest issue is that in most cases, once the airdrop has happened, if you don’t continue to reward the users for using the protocol, many will leave and move to the next project.”

Solutions for stopping airdrop hunters

Determining the identity of the individuals or groups behind airdrop hunting can be challenging due to the opaque nature of blockchain transactions, which can throw a wrench in the works for projects trying to clamp down on the practice.

Wei said that’s one of the main reasons airdrop hunting will likely continue, especially if the projects behind the airdrops do not implement stricter eligibility criteria or adopt measures to discourage airdrop hunting.

However, she noted that there are other options available for protocols, such as exploring alternative token distribution methods or implementing more stringent criteria to ensure a fairer distribution of tokens among participants.

According to Wei, one specific solution could be soulbound tokens (SBT), which are non-transferable and will ensure only genuine supporters receive rewards if projects only airdrop to SBT-holding addresses.

SBTs are digital identity tokens representing a person or entity’s traits, features and achievements and are issued by “souls,” which represent blockchain accounts or wallets.

Wei believes a shift toward using SBTs would also make token distribution more targeted and fairer.

“Adopting the SBT concept can make it more challenging for airdrop hunters, promoting a fairer token distribution and contributing to the ecological prosperity of the ecosystem,” she said.

“It helps ensure that airdrops are primarily directed at genuine supporters and engaged users rather than opportunistic airdrop hunters.”

Wei further argued that decentralized autonomous organizations could enforce governance fairness using SBT tokens for voting to avoid bot spamming.

Another approach could be using randomized distribution methods or limiting the number of tokens distributed per address to prevent disproportionate gains by airdrop hunters.

“Additionally, projects could focus on distributing tokens to their most active and engaged users, by considering factors like participation in the project’s community or usage of its platform, to encourage genuine participation and discourage airdrop hunting,” Wei said.

Emerging technologies such as blockchain are ushering in a new era of interactions between humans and the digital world. This is an evolving topic of conversation for thought leaders both inside and outside of the industry who are trying to predict how such technologies will prompt a change in the human experience.

On April 25, the reState Foundation hosted a virtual talk between the co-founder and inventor of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, and the founder of the Isha Foundation, the Indian mystic Sadhguru, to discuss the intersection of technology and human consciousness.

Buterin opened the conversation by highlighting that the core of blockchain technology is about “human coordination and interaction” with one another. He said:

“[Blockchain] is about helping different groups of people come together to be able to trust each other more, to collaborate across larger distances on many different kinds of projects.”

The talk promptly continued by pointing out a growing gap between the rate of technological evolution and the progression of human ethical and consciousness development, with the latter being left behind.

— Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) April 25, 2023

According to the Sadhguru, much of this blockage on the part of humans comes from the need to identify with a group. The yogi said this need for self-identification, therefore, surrenders intelligence over “protecting and defending the identity” of that group.

However, Buterin highlighted that new emerging tech actually makes it easier for people to recognize complicated identities and connect with one another on common ground. “Ultimately every technology is a social technology in some way,” he said.

“These are tools to help groups of people organize. There are tools to help people identify things that they value in common.”

He continued to say that while emerging technologies will not solve all problems of users, agreements and disagreements in the space have the potential to result in “realized cooperation” and learning opportunities. “I think those are the kinds of ideas that I know a lot of people in Ethereum and in those related communities really care about,” he said.

As these new technologies continue to take precedence in the lives of users and in systems around the world, Sadhguru encouraged listeners to be mindful that humans are the “highest level of technology” and by doing so we can improve the way we interact with technologies.

“Technology is not just something humans merely create; it is an extension of our consciousness. As we elevate our consciousness, our technology will automatically follow.”

Both speakers pointed to proper usage of technologies like blockchain as the key to its implementation as a tool for greater understanding and raising human consciousness.

Chainlink’s

 low-latency oracles will integrate with the decentralized exchange (DEX) GMX following a successful governance proposal that sought to provide more “granular” real-time market data to GMX v2.

Voting ended on April 25 at 12:00 am UTC, with over 96% of participating GMX tokenholders voting in favor of the proposal.

The new Chainlink oracles — which were built with the input of GMX core contributors — were brought in to improve upon the functionality of perpetual DEXs and price-sensitive trading on GMX, the author of the proposal explained.

The @GMX_IO community has officially approved a proposal to integrate Chainlink's new low-latency oracles as the launch partner in an on-chain vote with 96.28% approval.

This integration will enhance both the security and UX of GMX's derivatives protocol.https://t.co/sh1tLDLtps

— Chainlink (@chainlink) April 25, 2023

In addition, the low-latency oracles are said to strengthen security, further decentralize the protocol and improve upon the user experience, Johann Eid, the head of integration at Chainlink Labs, said.

While these new oracles utilize the same oracle node operators and data aggregation mechanisms used in existing Chainlink reference feeds, Eid explained that the new oracles extract data at a “higher frequency.”

“The new Chainlink low-latency oracles will utilize the same set of oracle node operators and multi-layered data aggregation mechanism currently deployed in existing Chainlink reference feeds, but operate via a pull-based mechanism to meet the speed requirements of DeFi derivatives.”

Eid explained the strengthened security will come from the low-latency oracles providing a “strong degree of tamper-resistance when settling user trades.”

Another Twitter commentator, Aylo, explained to their 62,600 followers on April 8 that the integration would “reduce exposure to stale price execution and value extraction” for GMX derivative traders.

So how does this help GMX?

In a nutshell:

— Aylo (@alpha_pls) April 8, 2023

A beta version of the GMX-tailored, low-latency oracle feeds — which have been in the works since 2022 — are now available on the Arbitrum testnet.

In return for the service, Chainlink will receive 1.2% of protocol fees generated by the low-latency oracles from the GMX protocol.

Protocol fees include the fees paid by users from margin trading in addition to standard borrow fees and swap fees.

Eid stated that Chainlink would continue to refine its oracle services to GMX as the protocol continues to “expand” and “evolve.”

It appears as though GMX isn’t the first perpetual DEX to get on board with the new type of oracle though.

Matt Losquadro, a former ambassador of on-chain derivatives platform Synthetix, said it integrated a similar solution first, which was observed by a member of the GMX community prior to the proposal being put forward:

Ordinals Finance, an Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to lend and borrow inscriptions, has been accused of performing an exit scam, also known as a “rug pull.”

In an April 24 press release seen by Cointelegraph, blockchain security firm CertiK reported that the protocol’s developer pulled 256 million OFI tokens out of its smart contracts using a “safuToken” function. Another 13 million OFI was removed through an “ownerRewithdraw” function, bringing the total number of tokens withdrawn to 269 million, CertiK stated.

#CertiKSkynetAlert

We can confirm that the @ordinalsfinance exit scam has resulted in a loss of $1 million.

All social media accounts have been deleted as well as the project's website.

Funds have been consolidated into EOA 0x34e…25cCFhttps://t.co/0Pwlt3yibm https://t.co/RA7vSjNajI

— CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) April 24, 2023

According to the blockchain security firm, the total loss to investors is $1 million. CoinGecko data shows that the market capitalization for OFI was $2.3 million before the alleged exit, but it fell to slightly over $143,000 afterward. This implies that losses were more than $2 million. However, some OFI token owners may have sold as the news broke, which may account for the lower amount being reported by CertiK. 

Blockchain data shows that the Ordinals deployer account withdrew over 256 million OFI tokens using the safuToken function. These funds were allegedly sent to a separate Ethereum account through multiple transactions. Blockchain data shows that this address received OFI from multiple addresses before depositing the tokens into Tornado Cash.

The project's Twitter account appears to have been deleted.

Further investigation reveals that after receiving the 256 million OFI, the deployer account made 12 separate transactions swapping OFI for Ether

The deployer then transferred over 85.5 ETH to the account ending in “cCF,” at which point it was deposited into Tornado Cash.

The safuToken transfer was executed on a contract labeled “OEB Staking.” This function is listed at the bottom of the file, on lines 1445-1450, and appears to allow the “owner” of the contract to transfer all staked tokens to itself.

The deployer account also made multiple calls to the OFI Staking contract to transfer tokens to itself, each time using a function on lines 305–308 called “ownerRewithdraw.” It appears to allow the owner to withdraw any amount of tokens from the staking contract, as long as the balance in the contract is greater than a variable called “totalOwedValue.”

— Thetanuts Finance (@ThetanutsFi) April 24, 2023

The funding round was led by crypto investment firms Polychain Capital, Hyperchain Capital and Magnus Capital.

Thetanuts currently offers DeFi Options Vaults, which are smart contracts allowing investors to sell call or put options on Ether 

ETH

$1,852

, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Fantom 

FTM

$0.37

, Avalanche

$15.46

 and other cryptocurrencies.

The team plans to employ the new funds to produce a “buy-side altcoin options market” to attract options purchasers. The announcement states that, until now, DeFi options protocols have focused on attracting sellers looking for steady income instead of options traders looking for leverage. Using the newly raised funds, the developers hope to be one of the first protocols to provide adequate products for the buy side of the options market.

They also hope to expand coin offerings to include more “altcoins,” or coins with smaller market caps, including tokens from networks that don’t use the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The new options market will combine aspects of an automated market maker and a traditional money market to produce a unique system for trading options. It will be available in beta “soon.”

Josh Rosenthal, portfolio manager at Polychain Capital, said the upcoming marketplace would support a stable financial market as the world transitions to Web3. “Functional derivatives are a key component of a healthy financial market,“ he said.

The traditional futures and options market traded over 60.6 billion contracts in the first nine months of 2022, according to research conducted by global trade organization FIA. As such, crypto firms are increasingly pivoting to the futures market. On April 20, Coinbase announced it is developing a Bermuda-based crypto derivatives exchange. On April 22, Gemini announced that it would also be offering Bitcoin

The first quarter of 2023 provided much-needed relief to the entire crypto community — from investors and miners to businesses and developers — as Bitcoin’s 

BTC

$27,734

 bull sprints helped crypto market participants recoup losses from prior investments. 

However, not all sub-ecosystems managed to replicate the recovery with the same intensity. In particular, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector suffered massive hacks, ultimately shaking investors’ confidence.

The DeFi ecosystem initially attracted investors seeking passive revenue streams, but 2022’s unforgiving bear market nullified many of the gains made from assets earned over time. As a result, both new and seasoned crypto entrepreneurs are now faced with the task of reinventing the DeFi wheel to offer sustainable investment opportunities as well as taking proactive measures to instill trust among investors.

Cointelegraph spoke on this topic with Julian Hosp, co-founder and CEO of Cake DeFi, taking a deep dive into what makes a DeFi ecosystem sustainable.

Cointelegraph: Crypto exchange volumes are recovering as a result of bull sprints, and nonfungible token volumes are up as well thanks to Bitcoin Ordinals — but volumes are still very low in DeFi despite promises of high yields. What went wrong?

Julian Hosp: On the contrary, the days of platforms touting sky-high yields are over. Today, we see yields adjusting at healthy, realistic, albeit much lower levels. We believe that this is actually a good sign, as it indicates that the industry is moving toward what we call “true DeFi.”

The corner of the crypto market that promised customers outrageous annual returns mainly attracted people looking to make a quick buck, those who were not necessarily true believers of DeFi.

Further, most of these lending platforms operated via a “black box” model whereby they offered limited transparency and control over customer funds. In these cases, customers do not have clarity on where the yields are being derived from or if their funds are being commingled with operational funds, which leaves them susceptible to mismanagement and misuse.

This was the case for companies like Celsius, Voyager, FTX and many others that imploded along with the market crash. Unfortunately, it took a fallout of this magnitude to clear out these bad actors.

The aforementioned collapses resulted in many mistakenly blaming DeFi as the cause when, in reality, these companies failed because they essentially repurposed the outdated big bank model under the guise of DeFi.

While DeFi has immense potential, more education is needed to quell the confusion and fear plaguing mainstream users. Additionally, it is crucial that crypto companies provide both assurance and protection to their users and their hard-earned money to build trust, especially in volatile times/during the crypto winter. Going forward, taking a transparency-first approach will become the gold standard for exchanges and custodians, and we expect customers to seek out CeDeFi [central decentralized finance] platforms.

CT: Gaining back investors’ attention often translates to rebuilding trust in the DeFi ecosystem. How does one achieve that in DeFi, considering that most projects are new?

JH: The spate of critical events that have occurred over the last year have rippled across the industry, sowing widespread distrust among investors. The industry has to rebuild that trust by going back to the roots of blockchain technology and putting the focus back on transparency. With that said, we believe that investors recognize that the issue is related more to traditional finance, not DeFi. However, more time and education are still needed to dispel confusion and rebuild that trust.

The string of bank collapses caused some people to lose confidence in TradFi and CeFi and to look for alternative ways to store and manage their wealth, such as DeFi. DeFi provides an alternative to CeFi by allowing individuals to access financial services and products without relying on traditional intermediaries, such as banks.

As a result, the DeFi ecosystem remains robust despite the volatile market. Liquidity does not leave DeFi. Even when prices drop, usage stays consistent. For instance, 1inch, one of the top DEXs on Ethereum, saw high volumes in the thick of the FTX crisis. Further, the global decentralized finance market size is expected to reach $231.19 billion by 2030, expanding at a CAGR [compound annual growth rate] of 42.5% from 2022 to 2030, according to a study conducted by Grand View Research, Inc.

CT: Investors are often advised to “do your own research” before trusting any project. What parameters do you recommend investors keep in mind?

JH: Investing in cryptocurrency can be a confusing and intimidating experience for even the savviest investor. With over 500 crypto investment platforms available, it is essential for investors to do their research before committing to one.

After deciding which type of crypto investment platform — a crypto exchange, crypto wallet, online brokerage, decentralized exchange — is the best fit, investors will then be able to make an informed decision about which specific platform best meets their needs. I believe that the best crypto investment platforms provide security and transparency, stable rewards, and ease of use.

Recent: Foreign trade and pensions: What’s next for Russia’s CBDC project?

First and perhaps most importantly, investors should consider the security features offered by the platform — if it has measures in place to protect customer funds from potential hacking attacks or other cyber-related threats. It is also important to check the platform’s track record when it comes to customer support. Transparency is also essential, as it gives investors peace of mind that their funds are secure and that the company behind the platform is legitimate. Without transparency, there will always be a cloud of doubt hanging over any given platform — something that no investor wants to experience.

When it comes to generating rewards on crypto, investors definitely want a platform that offers yield percentages that are both reasonable and reliable. Since yield percentages differ on every crypto investment platform, investors must carefully look into how or where the yields are generated, and whether the percentages in their preferred platform fluctuate too often or are too high. It is definitely a red flag if such information isn’t available or if the yield percentages are too good to be true.

DeFi protocols can be complex and challenging for the average user to navigate, and not everyone has the time or capability to understand the intricacies involved in crypto investing. For this reason, investors — especially beginners — should put ease of use on their list of considerations when choosing their crypto investment platform. Is it user-friendly? Is it available on mobile? Is it functional? These are some of the questions that you should be asking yourself before signing up for an account.

CT: As a service provider, what measures do you take to ensure investors’ safety?

JH: Last year, we published our proof of reserves using the cryptographically audited Merkle tree method in a continued effort to build trust and provide transparency around user funds. Proof of reserves is a means for platforms or exchanges to demonstrate that they are capable of honoring withdrawals on their platforms at all times. Cake DeFi was among the first in Asia to offer a comprehensive approach to proof of reserves that verifies not just assets but also liabilities as well.

Further, we provide full transparency on how yields are generated, with real-time on-chain data about customer funds. Users can ensure that their funds are safe and completely accounted for because all transactions can be verified directly on the blockchain.

CT: Q1 2023 saw Euler Finance hacked in one of the biggest DeFi exploits, with its CEO saying this occurred despite conducting 10 audits over two years. How effective are audits when it comes to security? Can the DeFi ecosystem solely rely on audits?

JH: In the crypto space, companies have a unique opportunity to demonstrate their financial health and liabilities through proofs of reserves and blockchain transparency. However, auditing these reserves can be prohibitively expensive for most companies, proving to be a major challenge. While some companies undergo audits, most players do not do so simply due to the high costs involved.

Additionally, demonstrating assets and liabilities can be difficult for exchanges compared with other types of companies in the crypto space. For example, as a CeDeFi provider, there are almost no idle funds on our platform, allowing such platforms to easily show customers where their funds are allocated. On the other hand, for exchanges, 99% of the funds are usually idle, making it difficult to show where the remaining 1% is — whether they be stored in a hot wallet or somewhere easily visible on a blockchain.

Furthermore, no code is perfect, and we have to understand and acknowledge that at the end of the day, there will always be unavoidable risks. While audits are effective at least in capturing some of the known issues, it does not mean that they are foolproof and will prevent all attack factors.

With that said, regulators should prioritize ensuring that companies have adequate safeguards in place to protect customer funds. I think having audits as a bare minimum is a good start. Comparing this to home safety — everyone implements basic safety measures such as locking their front door at all times, even if that doesn’t fully prevent a burglary from taking place (a burglar can climb in through a window, for example). Likewise, audits should not be viewed as a be-all, end-all solution, but rather a basic safety measure that everyone should implement.

CT: What are some best practices for security?

JH: The general rule of thumb is that the more opaque something is, the safer it is. Obscuring the exact security system so outsiders and insiders don’t know what the attack factors are is key. Even internally, no one person should know who holds certain keys and their locations. This will ensure protection and keep the ecosystem secure.

Another approach is to have as many multifactor authentications as possible, including automated checks, manual checks and more. Although not a foolproof method, MFA is an effective way to increase the security of cryptocurrency transactions and accounts.

It is also important to keep your platform’s software up-to-date with the latest security patches and bug fixes to stay ahead of potential vulnerabilities.

At Cake DeFi, we have very frequent and extensive manual checks on all our processes, which has its upsides and downsides. While this enhances the security of our platform and user funds, it causes slight delays in processing, and we sometimes get complaints from customers about the longer wait times.

At the end of the day, there is no perfect solution to safeguard one’s ecosystem, so it is crucial to follow best practices for security to protect your users’ funds and your project’s reputation.

CT: How important are user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for retaining customers? New investors can often be overwhelmed by the amount of information current UIs show.

JH: UI and UX are crucial elements of a successful product or application and have a significant impact on customer retention. A well-designed UI can make a product visually appealing and intuitive, while a positive UX can lead to satisfied customers who are more likely to use the product again and recommend it to others.

We have found that customers are easily put off by a poorly designed UI, which may prevent them from using the product from the get-go. Likewise, a negative UX can cause frustration, confusion and even anger, resulting in a high drop-off rate.

A well-designed UI can make a product easy to use, visually appealing and intuitive, which can lead to a positive experience for users. When users have a positive experience, they are more likely to return and use the product again, and even recommend it to others.

CT: In your experience, what factors do venture capitalists consider prior to making DeFi investments?

JH: Overall, venture capitalists take a comprehensive approach to evaluating DeFi projects and consider a wide range of factors to determine the potential for success before making an investment decision.

In the past, during the crypto bull run, it was all about hype. VCs would just crowd into different projects and throw money at them. This is actually what we are seeing today in the artificial intelligence industry. Whereas today in DeFi, VCs understand that this golden period is over and that they have to carefully look at other factors to determine which projects they should invest in.

One important factor is the market potential of the project, including its size, competition and growth rate. VCs also carefully examine the market fit as well as the team behind the project, including their experience, skill and track record in the industry. VCs will also look at the technology used in the project, such as its utility, feasibility, scalability and security features.

More specific to DeFi projects, VCs will evaluate the tokenomics of the project, including its token distribution, use cases and economic incentives for holding the token. They also consider the strength of the project’s community and its engagement level, as a strong community can drive adoption and increase the project’s value.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly in the current climate, VCs will take into account regulatory compliance, as regulatory uncertainty can pose serious risks to a DeFi project’s long-term success.

CT: “User experience drives adoption”: How accurate is this statement for DeFi? What are your thoughts on offering different UI experiences based on the type of investor, such as if they are new, moderately experienced or experts?

JH: There are many factors that drive the adoption of a product — be it a DeFi product or otherwise — and I agree that user experience ranks high on that list.

Theoretically, offering different UI versions based on investor type could be a useful feature. This approach would help to tailor our platform’s user experience to the needs of different types of investors, and could potentially attract and retain investors of varying levels of experience and investment goals. For example, a new investor may require a simpler and more intuitive UI with basic options, while an expert investor may prefer a more advanced UI with sophisticated investment tools and features.

Recent: Here’s how Ethereum’s ZK-rollups can become interoperable

Realistically, however, offering and maintaining multiple UI versions is complex and would require additional resources and time from the development team, in turn increasing costs.

CT: What is your advice for DeFi entrepreneurs?

JH: Build something that is useful. Build a product or service that people really want to use, something that has actual utility (not just attractive yield) that really adds value to the user.

CT: Is there anything else you would like to add?

JH: At this point in time, people are underestimating the power of DeFi because so much attention is being placed on nonfungible tokens and AI.

Especially with the recent string of banking system failures, I strongly believe there is immense potential in DeFi because there is such strength in having such a secure and transparent system without having a centralized chokepoint. So… don’t sleep on DeFi!

OVERVIEW
Join us on social networks

As an artificial language (AI) language model, ChatGPT can provide some guidance on how to become a game developer, but it cannot offer a comprehensive or personalized learning path. Here are some ways you can utilize ChatGPT to become a game developer:

Develop your programming skills

Game development requires strong programming skills, so start by learning programming languages such as C++, Java or Python. One can take online courses or tutorials to learn the basics of programming and practice writing code.

Here is an example of a Python code to create a simple “guess the number” game, where the player tries to guess a random number between 1 and 100:

The above code uses the built-in random module to generate the number and keeps track of the number of guesses the player makes. The main game loop continues until the player guesses the correct number, at which point the program prints a congratulatory message that includes the number of guesses it took the player to guess correctly.

If the player’s guess is incorrect, the program provides feedback to the player by telling them if their guess was too high or too low and then returns to the start of the game loop to get the player’s next guess.

Choose a game engine

There are many game engines available for beginners to start learning game development, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. One can ask ChatGPT to suggest game engines to begin the game development journey, and it may respond by suggesting a few, to begin with.

Here are some game engines that are beginner-friendly:

Unity: Unity is one of the most popular game engines among beginners, thanks to its user-friendly interface and extensive documentation. It supports multiple platforms, including PC, mobile and consoles, and has a large community of developers who create helpful tutorials and assets.
Unreal Engine: Unreal Engine is another popular game engine used by professional game developers, but it also has a lot of resources for beginners. It has powerful graphics capabilities, making it a good choice for creating 3D games. However, it may have a steeper learning curve than Unity.
Godot: Godot is an open-source game engine that is gaining popularity among indie game developers. It has a simple interface and is easy to learn, making it a good choice for beginners. It also supports 2D and 3D game development and has a strong community of developers.
Construct: Construct is a 2D game engine that is designed for beginners without prior programming experience. It has a drag-and-drop interface and a library of pre-built assets, making it easy to create simple games quickly.

Ultimately, the choice of game engine depends on one’s personal preferences and the type of game they want to develop. It’s a good idea to try out a few different game engines and see which one feels most comfortable and suitable for one’s needs.

Learn game design principles

Understanding game design principles is crucial to creating engaging and fun games. When beginning the game development journey, there are several game design principles that are important to keep in mind. Here are some key principles to consider:

Game mechanics: This refers to the rules and systems that govern how the game is played. The game mechanics should be clear, easy to understand and balanced to ensure that the game is enjoyable and challenging for players.
Player engagement: The game should be engaging and keep the player interested throughout. This can be achieved through various means, such as creating an immersive storyline, having interesting characters, and providing rewards or incentives for progression.
Visual design: The visual design of the game is crucial to its success. This includes the use of color, shapes and textures to create a visually appealing game world that enhances the player experience.
User interface (UI): The UI is the way in which the player interacts with the game, and it should be intuitive and easy to navigate. This includes elements such as menus, buttons and controls.
Playtesting: Playtesting involves having others play the game to identify any issues or areas for improvement. This can help to refine the game mechanics, identify bugs and improve the overall player experience.
Join game development communities

Joining online game development communities can provide valuable resources, support and feedback on one’s work. Websites such as GameDev.net, IndieDB and Itch.io offer forums, tutorials and resources for game developers.

In addition, Blockchain Game Alliance is a group of game developers, publishers and service providers who are committed to promoting blockchain technology in the gaming industry. They offer networking opportunities, events and resources for their members.

Hacks remain common in the crypto space, with over $320 million in digital assets lost in the first quarter of 2023. However, recent hacks have proven that some exploiters are willing to return assets in exchange for a prize, a process that some describe as a bug-bounty program with a criminal twist.

In April alone, there were at least three incidents of hackers returning exploited funds in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. On April 4, the Euler Finance team was able to recover $176.4 million after offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds.

Similarly, lending protocol Sentiment was able to recover almost $1 million in stolen funds after negotiating with its hacker. More recently, the attacker who was able to take $8.9 million from DeFi protocol SafeMoon agreed to return 80% of the funds.

While the recent hacks could’ve theoretically been avoided through safe and profitable bug-bounty programs, they may be a result of bounty offers not being worth it from the perspective of a white hat or ethical hacker.

Steven Walbroehl, the co-founder of security firm Halborn, said that it’s very common for companies to refuse to pay out bug bounties and not take vulnerabilities reported very seriously. As a former bounty hunter, Walbroehl said that some bounty programs have left him “feeling cheated” out of his time. He explained:

“Putting yourself in the shoes of a researcher, if you find an exploit that can create millions of dollars in stolen funds, but the developer is only offering a $5,000 reward, it can create a disproportionate amount of incentive to not take the bounty.”

Walbroehl also said that companies would often downplay the discoveries, saying that the bugs were not critical. Reporting bugs also sometimes leads to companies not paying up, claiming that their team has already located the bug by themselves, according to Walbroehl.

Simon Zhu, the senior product director at blockchain security firm CertiK, said platforms really need to create programs that are safe and profitable for developers. While having funds returned is a win, Zhu told Cointelegraph that this would not be a welcome trend, as attackers are essentially holding the funds hostage. Zhu explained:

“White hat bug-bounty programs are clearly preferable here. Platforms that do not offer a bug-bounty program allowing for the safe and profitable disclosure of vulnerabilities may find themselves paying a much higher price.”

In addition, Zhu also urged projects to change their line of thinking when it comes to vulnerabilities. According to the cybersecurity executive, some developer teams tend to ignore minor bugs when the costs of fixing the bug are high or when the smart contract becomes more complex to modify after the bug gets fixed.

However, the CertiK executive highlighted that in Web3, a minor vulnerability can become a major one overnight. “Playing chicken with user deposits is not a responsible long-term approach to security,” Zhu added.

"How is artificial intelligence used in fraud detection?","AI can contribute to fraud management by detecting data anomalies, identifying fraudulent behavior patterns and automating fraud detection processes.","1.
How can artificial intelligence help detect fraud?

Artificial Intelligence can play a crucial role in fraud management by detecting and preventing fraudulent activities.

The global average rate of losses caused by fraud for the last two decades represents 6.05% of the gross domestic product. Additionally, companies have reported that cyber breaches have caused financial damages equaling 3% to 10% of their revenue. Moreover, global digital fraud losses are projected to exceed $343 billion between 2023 and 2027.

Given the estimated amounts, it is a crucial question for any organization to build up an efficient fraud management system. Fraud management is identifying, preventing, detecting and responding to fraudulent activities within an organization.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has a significant role in fraud management. AI technologies, such as machine learning (ML) algorithms, can analyze large amounts of data and detect patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activities. AI-powered fraud management systems can identify and prevent various types of fraud, such as payment fraud, identity theft or phishing attacks. They can also adapt and learn from new fraud patterns and trends, improving their detection over time.

AI-based solutions can also integrate with other security systems, such as identity verification and biometric authentication, to provide a more comprehensive approach to fraud prevention.

2.
How can machine learning algorithms help in fraud detection and prevention?

Machine learning algorithms are designed to recognize patterns based on a large amount of data, which can be leveraged to identify fraudulent activities.

AI refers to technologies that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, such as analyzing data or understanding and responding to human language. They are designed to recognize patterns and make predictions in real time. AI algorithms are often a combination of different ML models.

ML is a subset of AI; it uses algorithms to analyze large amounts of data to enable systems to learn autonomously. The more data ML algorithms are exposed to, the better they perform over time. The two main approaches of ML are supervised machine learning (SML) and unsupervised machine learning (UML). SML algorithms use labeled data to help predict outcomes, while UML algorithms discover hidden patterns in the data.

As an example, SML algorithms use historical transaction data labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent that will be used to train the supervised machine learning model. UML would use anomaly detection algorithms to identify transactions significantly different from the norm based on given features. While UML models require less human intervention, they tend to be less accurate than SML.

3.
How can AI improve cybersecurity?

AI technologies have a vital role in fighting cybercrime by enhancing the most commonly used cybersecurity systems.

AI and ML have a crucial role in online fraud detection, where algorithms detect fraudulent activities in online transactions, such as credit cards, online banking or e-commerce transactions. These algorithms can be applied in real-time to identify and flag suspicious activities. 

A cybersecurity threat is any activity, event or situation that has the potential to cause harm to computer systems, networks or data. According to the Global Economic Crime and Fraud Survey 2022, after customer fraud, the second most common type of threat that financial services face is cybercrime.

Cybercrime refers to criminal activities involving technology, such as computers, networks or the internet. These activities can result in various harms, including financial loss, data theft or destruction and reputation damage. The most common cyber threats include hacking, phishing, identity theft and malware.

A Cyberattack is a specific type of cybercrime that involves an intentional attempt by a third party to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to a system or network.

Cybersecurity is defending different systems, networks and devices from malicious attacks. A crucial element of cybersecurity systems is the real-time monitoring of all electronic resources. The biggest software companies, like IBM, already use AI-powered technologies to enhance their cybersecurity solutions. 

4.
What are the main benefits of using AI in fraud detection?

Using AI in fraud detection can lead to a faster, more accurate and more efficient process without compromising the customer experience.

The key benefits are discussed below:

Enhanced accuracy: AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns and anomalies that are difficult for humans to detect. AI algorithms can even learn from data and improve over time, increasing accuracy.
Real-time monitoring: With AI algorithms, organizations can monitor real-time transactions, allowing for immediate detection and response to potential fraud attempts.
Reduced false positives: One of the challenges of fraud detection is the occurrence of false positives, where legitimate transactions are mistakenly flagged as fraudulent. The learning feature of AI algorithms reduces false positives.
Increased efficiency: AI algorithms can automate repetitive tasks, such as reviewing transactions or verifying identities, reducing the need for manual intervention.
Cost reduction: fraudulent activities can have significant financial and reputational consequences for organizations. By reducing the number of fraudulent cases, AI algorithms can save organizations money and protect their reputation.
5.
What are the potential risks of using AI in fraud detection?

Using AI-powered technologies also holds certain risk factors, which can be partly handled by explainable AI solutions.

The potential risks of AI in fraud detection are discussed below:

Biased algorithms: AI algorithms depend on training data which can be biased. If the training data contains biases, the algorithm may produce inaccurate results.
False positive or false negative results: Automated systems can lead to false positives or false negative cases. False positive means that a transaction is incorrectly labeled as malicious activity, while fraudulent activity is neglected in the case of false negative.
Lack of transparency: Certain AI algorithms can be difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand why a particular transaction was labeled as potentially fraudulent.

Explainable AI can help to partly overcome the incorporated risk factors. The term refers to the development of AI systems that can explain their decision-making processes in a way humans can understand. In the context of fraud detection, explainable AI can provide clear and interpretable explanations for why a particular transaction or activity was identified as potentially fraudulent.

For instance, The Montreal Declaration for Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence outlines ethical principles for AI development, including transparency and explainability.

6.
How can criminals take advantage of AI?

The same features that make AI valuable for legitimate purposes can also make it a powerful tool for cybercriminals.

Here are a few examples of attacks that can happen if criminals exploit AI:

Adversarial attacks: Adversarial attacks are a type of attack where fraudsters attempt to deceive or manipulate AI systems. For example, fraudsters may modify or manipulate data to evade detection or trick the algorithm into classifying fraudulent activity as legitimate.
Malware: AI can be used to create and distribute malware designed to evade detection by security systems. Malware can be used to steal sensitive data, disrupt critical systems or launch attacks against other targets.
Social engineering: AI can generate sophisticated phishing attacks designed to trick users into revealing sensitive information or installing malware on their devices. AI can also be used to create convincing fake identities and social media profiles, which can be used to deceive victims and gain access to their accounts.
Botnets: AI can be applied to build and manage botnets, which are networks of infected devices that can be used to launch coordinated attacks against targets. Botnets can be used to launch distributed denial-of-service attacks and spread malware.
7.
What is the role of AI in crime prevention?

There are several existing solutions for crime prevention with the help of AI-based technologies; however, a few of them raise ethical concerns.

AI can be used in crime prevention by analyzing data that may indicate criminal activity. One example of an existing solution is the PredPol system, which uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical crime data and identify patterns in the time and location of crimes. Based on these patterns, the system generates “predictive hotspots” that indicate where crimes are most likely to occur in the future.

A well-known example of fraud prevention in blockchain transactions is Chainalysis. The company applies machine learning algorithms to monitor and analyze the flow of cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchain networks. By analyzing the patterns of these transactions, experts can identify suspicious activities and track the flow of funds across different addresses and accounts.

The crime prevention system of China is a controversial example of AI-based solutions. The system relies on three pillars: Facial recognition tools help authorities to identify suspected criminals, big data tools allow police to analyze behavioral data to detect criminal activities, and a machine learning tool supports the creation of a database involving every citizen. The result is an extensive data-powered rating system that identifies suspicious individuals based on background and behavior signals.

It’s important to mention that AI in crime prevention has several limitations and raises serious ethical and privacy concerns. There are many debates about the accuracy and bias of some of these systems. It’s crucial to ensure they are designed and used responsibly, with proper safeguards to protect individual rights and prevent abuse.

8.
What can AI do if a crime has already been committed?

The features of efficient data processing and pattern recognition can also be valuable features of AI in the case of forensic investigation.  

Forensic investigation is the scientific method of researching criminal cases. It involves gathering and analyzing all sorts of case-related data and evidence. The nature of data is often complex, taking the form of texts, images or videos. AI can help handle data effectively and perform meta-analysis during the investigation.

AI algorithms can be trained to recognize patterns in data, such as handwriting, fingerprints or faces. They can be used to analyze written or spoken language, such as emails and text messages, as well as images and videos, to identify objects, people and events. 

In addition, AI can aid in investigating and prosecuting the perpetrators. For instance, predictive modeling — a type of AI technology — can use historical crime data to create predictive models to help law enforcement anticipate and prevent future crimes. 

To evaluate crime data and pinpoint regions that are more likely to experience criminal activity, police departments in some cities can use predictive policing algorithms. This enables them to allocate resources more skillfully and stop crime in its tracks. Predictive modeling can also be used to identify individuals at risk of committing crimes, allowing law enforcement to intervene before any criminal activity occurs.","https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-is-artificial-intelligence-used-in-fraud-detection"

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is one of the largest sectors in crypto. The applications within the DeFi space consist of decentralized trading, borrowing and lending, and many more financial services. However, even with its rising popularity, the sector has many obstacles to overcome before mass adoption is possible.

The rise of DeFi 

The growth of DeFi’s popularity was volatile and quick, which follows suit with the overall development of the crypto industry. During the peaks of 2021, the sector saw almost $180 billion in total value locked in the many protocols that still exist today. Of course, the DeFi space also got hit by the crypto winter.

Recently, DeFi stood out in the market upturn during the first quarter of 2023. The DeFi space rose $29.6 billion in value, making the sector stand out against the performances of major asset classes like gold and oil.

The popularity of DeFi can be attributed to the increasing amount of decentralized applications (DApps) and the flow of users from centralized to decentralized exchanges, among other reasons. However, while the increasing popularity is a positive development, there are some caveats.

Rise in transaction costs

One of the caveats is the rising transaction costs once more users start using a network. Investors experienced this during the bull market in 2021; the Ethereum 

ETH

$1,852

 network saw a large influx of transactions, mainly happening within the DeFi space. The result was steeply rising transaction costs on the network. Sending crypto became so expensive that users faced a significant barrier to interacting with DeFi DApps.

Another risk is that of vulnerabilities such as smart contract back door keys, massive centralization on single contracts, and counter-party risks of custodial stablecoins. With numerous bridge hacks plaguing the space, and failures of algorithmic protocols such as Terra, using DeFi DApps is certainly not without risk. However, the industry keeps evolving, with many new platforms aiming to improve the issues and challenges current DApps deal with.

DeFi on Bitcoin Cash

Thanks to the continuous development since its foundation in 2017, Bitcoin Cash 

BCH

$121

 can also perform as a vibrant environment for smart contract deployment and the creation of DeFi DApps on its UTXO mainchain. One new project that has recently launched is BCH Bull.

With the help of the AnyHedge protocol, BCH Bull lets users create long or hedge positions on several assets, such as the United States dollar, Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,734

 and gold. Users can even add leverage to their on-chain trades. Roger Ver, a well-known Bitcoin Cash supporter and early investor in AnyHedge, said about this use case: “Allowing people to permissionlessly lock the value of their Bitcoin Cash to the price of external legacy currencies is an incredibly useful tool for people who don’t want to deal with cryptocurrency price volatility. That’s why I chose to invest in AnyHedge.”

Source: BCH Bull

Scalable and no centralized smart contract risks

The main difference between comparable apps on Ethereum is that each trade has its own independent smart contract. Once two traders agree on the terms, the smart contract is initiated. This eliminates centralized security risks for smart contracts.

Furthermore, the UTXO-based protocol of Bitcoin Cash prevents high transaction fees and makes the chain scalable, meaning fees don’t increase even if the transaction volume on the network increases.

Since October 2022, BCH Bull has been in beta, in which it has already created and redeemed over 3,000 smart contracts. The project has now been released into full production mode this month. Its growing user base can now initiate up to 90-day-long contracts at 2~3x the previous contract size, enjoying the security and scalability that Bitcoin Cash offers.

Join us on social networks

Blockchain has been recognized for its potential to transform finance and other industries that rely on data, but what happens when innovation meets the world’s oldest industry — agriculture? It turns out that blockchain has a lot to offer to the food and agriculture sectors, especially when merged with other innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), satellites and the Internet of Things (IoT).

The agricultural sector can join the tech revolution to upgrade every aspect that has to do with transactions and data. For example, blockchain could streamline processes related to the supply chain by increasing traceability and bringing automation to the table.

A report from InsightAce Analytics found that blockchain in the agriculture and food supply chain is a market valued at over $280 million as of 2022, and is expected to grow to over $7 billion by 2031, demonstrating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 43.76% during that period.

How can blockchain help agriculture businesses?

Thanks to its unique architecture that involves decentralization, blockchain ensures the highest possible degree of transparency and traceability, which are key elements in the agricultural sector. Decentralized networks enable participants, including farmers, producers, retailers and exporters, to monitor and address major challenges showing up in the supply chain. Eventually, blockchain records can be used for analysis purposes to improve various aspects of the supply chain.

The adoption of blockchain in agriculture can also help regulatory compliance and reporting. By ensuring the provision of accurate, up-to-date, tamper-proof data, stakeholders can make better-informed decisions and implement proper corporate governance. Decentralized networks also simplify the distribution of certification data among relevant parties.

Besides transparency, blockchain can facilitate other advancements in the agricultural sector. For instance, it can enable better management of land rights, more efficient food safety tracking, and enhanced traceability of inputs like seeds and fertilizers.

Farmers can leverage permissioned and permissionless solutions

Tech giants have realized the potential of decentralized ledger technology for agriculture. For example, IBM provides businesses with a permissioned blockchain platform called IBM Food Trust, which offers multiple features, including proof of origin, traceability, fraud monitoring and documentation, among others.

Agricultural companies can also leverage blockchain solutions that rely on public networks, which ensure a higher degree of decentralization and security. One example is Dimitra, an AgTech company that aims to help farmers reduce the amount of labor required to complete manual tasks by integrating its technology stack, which combines blockchain, AI, IoT, drones and satellites.

Dimitra offers digital solutions to help farmers gather data to make smarter and faster decisions to improve their crop yields and increase sustainability.

For Dimitra CEO Jon Trask, the integration of blockchain and other innovative technologies into agricultural processes is natural and imperative. He said: “Every smallholder farmer, regardless of economic status, should be able to benefit from simple, beautiful and useful technology, because when farmers thrive, economies thrive.”

Dimitra offers four main AgTech applications:

Connected Farmer — this flagship platform aims to assist small-scale farmers in documenting their agricultural practices, generating and obtaining comprehensive dashboard reports, and offering guidance to help them make well-informed choices. The platform relies on blockchain and uses several other innovative technologies to provide farmers with valuable data. The advanced version of the platform includes features like a sensor management module, satellite and weather, an online agricultural marketplace, as well as track, trace and export documents.
Livestock Guru — the platform utilizes DNA data to monitor animal lineage. Identifying parentage and carriers of recessive traits improves the selection process for reproduction within herds, ultimately leading to superior quality and more robust livestock products.
Connected Coffee — this all-in-one solution allows coffee farmers, traders and other stakeholders to grow and distribute coffee worldwide. This smart farming and supply chain management app tracks the movement of coffee from cultivation to distribution. 
Deforestation platform — the European Union has banned imports of products associated with deforestation, such as palm oil, cattle, soy and timber. Products from farms involved in deforestation after December 2020 are prohibited. To comply, consumer goods companies, importers and farmers must certify their adherence to these regulations. Dimitra offers a Deforestation Certification Module, which uses satellite imagery and machine learning to assess compliance and generate blockchain-based certificates.

The Dimitra ecosystem is fueled by its proprietary Ethereum-based token, DMTR. It acts as a utility token for the Connected Farmer app that helps farmers worldwide increase sustainability and make informed decisions.

To spread its mission and technology, Dimitra is also working with governments, agencies, NGOs and for-profit organizations. The company was awarded a contract from the OBC Indian Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture for deploying its Connected Farmer app to 1.3 million farms for soil assessment and remediation. Elsewhere, Dimitra partnered with an organization in the world’s third-largest fruit producing country, the Brazilian Association of Fruit Producers and Exporters. Its members represent more than 85% of the total fruit exported by Brazil.

Dimitra has demonstrated that integrating blockchain with other innovations like AI, satellites and IoT can revolutionize the agricultural sector. By increasing transparency, traceability and efficiency, these advancements offer major opportunities for improving supply chain management, regulatory compliance and land rights management.

Crypto assets are a high-risk investment. You should consider whether you understand the possibility of losing money due to leverage. None of the material should be considered as investment advice!","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-cash-bch-is-now-home-to-an-innovative-leverage-trading-app"
"How is artificial intelligence revolutionizing financial services?","This article explores how artificial intelligence is transforming the financial services industry, from fraud detection to customer service and beyond.","1.
What is the role of artificial intelligence in the financial services industry?

AI is proving to be a powerful tool for financial institutions looking to improve their operations, manage risks, and optimize their portfolios more effectively.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly vital role in the financial services industry. Predictive analytics, which can assist financial firms in better understanding and anticipating client demands, preferences and behaviors, is one of the most well-known uses of AI. They can then use this information to create goods and services that are more individually tailored.

Moreover, AI is also being utilized to enhance risk management and fraud detection in the financial services industry. AI systems can swiftly identify unusual patterns and transactions that can point to fraud by evaluating massive amounts of data in real-time. This can assist financial organizations in reducing overall financial risk and preventing fraud-related losses.

In addition, AI is being used for portfolio optimization and financial forecasting. By utilizing machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics, financial institutions can optimize their portfolios and make more accurate investment decisions.

2.
How are machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) utilized in finance?

Machine learning, deep learning and NLP are helping financial institutions improve their operations, enhance customer experiences, and make more informed decisions. These technologies are expected to play an increasingly significant role in the finance industry in the coming years.

Financial organizations may make better decisions by using machine learning to examine massive volumes of data and find trends. For instance, machine learning can be used to forecast stock prices, credit risk and loan defaulters, among other things.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes neural networks to model and resolve complicated issues. For instance, deep learning is being used in finance to create models for detecting fraud, pricing securities and managing portfolios.

Natural language processing (NLP) is being used in finance to enable computers to understand human language and respond appropriately. NLP is used in financial chatbots, virtual assistants and sentiment analysis tools. It enables financial institutions to improve customer service, automate customer interactions and develop better products and services. 

3.
How does AI help in fraud detection and risk management in financial services?

AI is proving to be a powerful tool for financial institutions looking to improve their fraud detection and risk management processes, enabling them to operate more efficiently and effectively while minimizing potential losses.

Here are the steps explaining how AI helps in fraud detection and risk management in financial services:

Data collection: The first step entails gathering data from multiple sources, including market, customer and transactional data. Then, machine learning models are trained using this data.
Data preprocessing: Once the data has been gathered, they need to be cleaned up to get rid of any errors or inconsistencies. This guarantees the reliability and accuracy of the data.
Machine learning modeling: To identify potential fraudulent actions or risks, machine learning algorithms are subsequently employed to examine the preprocessed data. Algorithms, for instance, can be trained to spot fraudulent behavior patterns in transaction data or to forecast possible hazards linked with investments.
Real-time monitoring: AI systems are then used to keep an eye on transactions and spot potential fraud. This makes it possible for financial institutions to act fast and stop losses.
Compliance: AI can also assist financial organizations in meeting legal standards for risk and fraud management. For instance, AI algorithms can be used to spot potential contraventions of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws and pinpoint areas where risk management procedures need to be improved.
Continuous improvement: AI models need to be updated and enhanced continuously based on fresh information and user input. This guarantees that the models will continue to be reliable and efficient in identifying fraud and controlling risks.

4.
What is the use of chatbots and virtual assistants in the financial industry?

Chatbots and virtual assistants are proving to be valuable tools for financial institutions looking to improve the customer experience, reduce costs and operate more efficiently.

Chatbots and virtual assistants are utilized to provide individualized services and assistance, which enhances the client experience. Customers can communicate with these AI-powered tools in real-time and receive details on their accounts, transactions and other financial services. They can also be used to respond to commonly asked inquiries, offer financial counsel and assist clients with challenging problems.

Suppose a bank customer wanted to check their account balance or ask a question about a recent transaction, but the bank’s customer service center was closed. The customer can make use of the bank’s chatbot or virtual assistant to receive the information they require in real-time rather than having to wait until the following day to speak with a customer support agent.

The virtual assistant or chatbot can verify the customer’s identification and give them access to their account balance or transaction details. If the customer has a more complex issue, the chatbot or virtual assistant can escalate it to a human representative for further assistance. This means that AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can provide immediate responses to customer inquiries, reducing wait times and improving customer satisfaction.

Because they are accessible round-the-clock, chatbots and virtual assistants are useful resources for clients who require support outside of conventional office hours. Through the automation of repetitive processes and the elimination of the need for human support, they can also assist financial organizations in cutting expenses.

5.
What are the benefits and potential drawbacks of AI in the financial services industry?

The financial services industry can enjoy several benefits from AI systems, such as automating mundane tasks, improving risk management and swift decision-making. Nevertheless, the drawbacks of AI, such as security risks, potential bias and absence of a human touch, should not be ignored.

Potential advantages of AI in the financial services industry include:

Improved efficiency: AI can automate routine processes and reduce the need for human intervention, improving efficiency and reducing costs.
Better risk management: AI can analyze vast amounts of data to identify potential risks and prevent losses.
Enhanced customer experience: AI can provide personalized services and round-the-clock assistance, improving customer satisfaction.
Faster decision-making: AI can analyze data and make decisions much faster than humans, enabling financial institutions to respond quickly to changing market conditions.

The possible disadvantages of using AI in the financial services industry consist of:

Security risks: AI systems can be vulnerable to cyberattacks, posing a security risk to financial institutions and their customers.
Privacy concerns: The use of AI in financial services can raise concerns about data privacy, as the technology requires access to large volumes of personal and financial data, which must be secured and protected from unauthorized access or use.
Bias: AI systems can be biased based on the data they are trained on, potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes.
Regulatory challenges: The use of AI in financial services is subject to regulatory oversight, and compliance with regulations can be challenging.
Lack of human touch: Customers may prefer interacting with humans for certain financial services, such as complex financial advice or emotional support during difficult financial situations.
Job displacement: The use of AI in financial services may lead to job displacement as certain tasks become automated.
6.
What is the future of AI in financial services?

The future of AI in finance is exciting, with the potential to improve efficiency, accuracy and customer experience. However, it will be essential for financial institutions to carefully manage the risks and challenges associated with the use of AI.

The use of AI in financial services has the potential to significantly improve the sector. Several facets of finance have already been transformed by AI, including fraud detection, risk management, portfolio optimization and customer service.

Automating financial decision-making is one area where AI is anticipated to have a large impact in the future. This could involve the examination of massive amounts of financial data using machine learning algorithms, followed by the formulation of investment recommendations. With AI, customized investment portfolios might be constructed for clients depending on their risk appetite and financial objectives.

In addition, AI-powered recommendation engines could also be developed to offer customers targeted products and services that meet their needs. This could improve customer experience and satisfaction while also increasing revenue for financial institutions.

However, there are also potential challenges associated with the use of AI in finance. These include data privacy concerns, regulatory compliance issues, and the potential for bias and discrimination in algorithmic decision-making. It will be important for financial institutions to ensure that AI is used in a responsible and ethical way and that appropriate safeguards, such as transparent algorithms and regular audits, are in place to mitigate these risks.","https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-is-artificial-intelligence-revolutionizing-financial-services"

Criticism has been leveled at a new euro-pegged stablecoin released in France due to a decision to restrict peer-to-peer transactions.

French bank Societe Generale-Forge (SGF) released the Ethereum-based stablecoin called EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) on April 20, which is available to only qualified institutional clients.

According to observers who reviewed its smart contract code, itsERC-20 transfers need to first be approved by a centralized registrar — presumably one controlled by the bank — before the transaction is processed.

In an April 20 tweet, pseudonymous smart contract engineer “alephv.eth” explained:

“They coded it so they have to whitelist all users, process all user transfers, and even process your ERC20 approvals before they process your 'transferFrom' lmao.”

She further mocked the code in a separate post, stating it was a ""radical commitment to inefficiency in the name of regulation.""

Nonfungible token project founder “foobar” tweeted to his over 127,000 followers on April 20 that it’s “the worst code I’ve ever seen” and described the stablecoin as a “laughing stock.”

Crypto researcher Mason Versluis tweeted that the code was “absolutely horrible” and suggested the French bank “stop trying to weasel” into crypto.

Plenty of others chipped in on the criticism, but Ether

 investor Ryan Berckman provided a more neutral analysis.

He explained that many traditional financial firms like SGF will take “baby steps” as they move into blockchain and digital assets:

“Obviously, non-compliant, non-composable, allowlist-style stables are going to be uncompetitive in the market. Baby steps, they are coming from tradfi, they’ll see it soon enough and switch to a USDC-style denylist.”

Berckman explained SGF may also be incorrect in its claim to be the first bank to launch an institutional stablecoin on a public blockchain. He pointed to the AUDN stablecoin minted on Ethereum in March by National Australia Bank (NAB), which claimed to be the second bank to launch a stablecoin.

Regardless, Berckman expects more banks to follow suit in the months to come, stating that he is “certain” SGF won’t be the last bank to launch a stablecoin on a public network.

SGF’s stablecoin isn’t intended for public use — at least to begin with.

EURCV is only strictly available to institutional clients onboarded by the bank through its Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, according to the bank’s April 20 announcement.

The stablecoin is designed to bridge the gap between assets in traditional capital markets and the digital assets ecosystem.

A total of 10 million EURCV tokens were minted on Ethereum on April , according to Ethereum explorer Etherscan. All 10 million tokens are held by one wallet address.

The stablecoin was launched on the back of growing demand for a new settlement asset to process on-chain transactions.

TransUnion, one of the three major United States credit reporting agencies, announced on April 20 that it would begin supplying credit scoring to public blockchain networks. Off-chain credit data have not previously been available to Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

In the new TransUnion service, credit information will be made available to decentralized applications, or DApps, at the consumer's request. Complete credit information will be delivered to the consumer, and excerpts will go to the DApp.

TransUnion partnered with Spring Labs and Quadrata to provide credit data through a digital passport network that will protect the consumer’s identity on the blockchain. The project apparently took some time to get off the ground, as it was first announced over a year ago.

TransUnion executive vice president of financial services Jason Laky said the new product will help minimize lenders’ risk while “providing borrowers more opportunity for better terms.” TransUnion claimed it “can offer credit scoring for nearly the entire U.S. adult population” and has operating associates in more than 30 countries.

Credit scoring has long been a sore spot for DeFi. TransUnion competitor Experian announced at the beginning of 2023 that it was partnering with Bulgarian DeFi lending platform Credefi. That deal gave Credefi “the rights to use Experian's officially recognized and reputable brand materials.” Experian will participate in European Green Company scoring through the deal. In October, Equifax, the other major TransUnion competitor, said it was partnering with the Oasis blockchain to provide Know Your Customer services.

1inch Network is the latest of a host of Ethereum-based platforms and services deploying on the zero-knowledge proof (zk-proof) based scaling platform. Uniswap, SushiSwap, Maker and Curve Finance are also preparing to launch on the zk-proof roll-up zkSync Era.

1inch Network co-founder Sergej Kunz highlighted the promise of the layer-2 solution as his platform joins a handful of first-movers to integrate with the zk-proof powered protocol:

“As zkSync Era gains steam, 1inch users will benefit from faster and cheaper transactions.”

A statement from Matter Labs CEO Alex Gluchowski, who heads up the zkSync development firm, notes that DeFi protocols have been a major factor in the uptake of zkSync era:

“DeFi has been a driving force behind zkSync Era’s explosive growth that has seen over $200 million in TVL driven to the protocol in just three short weeks, and we expect the deployment of 1inch to contribute to even greater adoption and usage of zkSync Era.”

Gluchowski said that 1inch Network’s position as the largest decentralized exchange aggregator by on-chain volume would provide deeper liquidity to zkSync Era. The deployment is also touted to offer faster trades, better rates and lower transaction slippage.

Related: Symbiosis integrates zkSync: ‘Natural evolution’ of scaling solutions

zkSync is among a number of layer-2 solutions that have pioneered the use of zk-rollups to increase Ethereum’s throughput and scalability. The technology enables layer-2 protocols to move computation and blockchain state storage offchain, allowing these platforms to process thousands of transactions before providing summary data proofs to Ethereum’s mainnet.

Matter Labs secured $200 million during a series-c investment round in November 2022, taking its total fundraising to over $450 million to continue the development of its Ethereum scaling platform.

Other major Ethereum development firms, including Polygon and ConsenSys, have also developed their own zk-proof powered scaling protocols. ConsenSys released its zkEVM rollup to its public testnet on March 28.

Meanwhile, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal described zk-rollups as “the holy grail of Ethereum scaling” upon the release of its open-source zkEVM Ethereum scaling technology to the mainnet on March 27.

BlockFi, a lender of digital assets, was given additional time to submit a bankruptcy exit plan by a New Jersey bankruptcy judge in the United States on April 19.

The cryptocurrency lender filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 and has been reportedly granted a 48-day extension until May 15 to file an exit plan. The crypto firm is exploring a potential sale of company assets or the possibility of getting an outside backer to support a restructuring deal, BlockFi lawyer Joshua Sussberg said in a hearing Wednesday.

According to the bankruptcy code, debtors are expected to propose a Chapter 11 plan within the first 120 days of filing. Thus, BlockFi has been required to present a plan by March 27. However, on March 21, the company filed a request to prolong the deadline for its Chapter 11 plan by 90 days to June 26.

BlockFi’s lawyers said in defense of the request to prolong the deadline, “much work remains” due to the scale and complexity of the Chapter 11 cases. The company is estimated to owe up to $10 billion to over 100,000 creditors. Judge Michael Kaplan, the bankruptcy judge handling the case, reportedly deemed it worthwhile to extend the deadline to ensure the smooth continuation of the case.

A committee of BlockFi customers argued they should be allowed to take control of the bankruptcy case so cryptocurrency held on the platform can be returned to creditors immediately. Committee lawyer Robert Stark told Kaplan that BlockFi creditors aren’t sophisticated lenders but individual mom-and-pop retail customers, “many of whom have lost their life savings,” according to reports.

Stark claimed that BlockFi lacks a workable business for reorganization and is likely to sell its platform, which he referred to as a “bundle of sticks.” Although Kaplan rejected the committee’s appeal, he chose to grant a deadline extension shorter than the one requested by BlockFi.

According to Sussberg, the length of the extension was “modest,” and he stated that the company would have a plan ready for unsecured creditors to evaluate within two weeks.

Here’s a brief history of digital banking.

Early automation (1960s to 1980s)

The first forms of digital banking can be traced back to the 1960s, when banks began using mainframe computers to automate various banking functions such as check processing and customer account management. In the 1980s, banks started offering dial-up services that allowed customers to access their accounts through their home computers.

In the 1960s, Bank of America introduced the first ATM, which allowed customers to withdraw cash from their accounts without needing a bank teller. Also, In the 1980s, Citibank introduced the first online banking system, which allowed customers to access account information and perform basic transactions through a dial-up connection.

Introduction of online banking (1990s to 2000s)

Online banking portals were developed due to increased internet use in the 1990s and 2000s. Banks started creating online portals to enable consumers to see account balances, transfer money and pay bills from their home computers. Online banking quickly became a preferred option for many people due to its convenience.

For instance, in 1994, Stanford Federal Credit Union became the first financial institution to offer online banking to its members, and in 1996, Wells Fargo became the first bank to provide online banking to its customers.

Mobile banking (2000s to present)

The proliferation of smartphones in the late 2000s and early 2010s led to the emergence of mobile banking. Banks began offering mobile apps that allowed customers to access their accounts from their smartphones, enabling them to check account balances, transfer funds, and pay bills on the go. Today, mobile banking has become an essential part of the digital banking landscape.

In 2007, USAA Federal Savings Bank became the first bank to offer mobile banking through its mobile app. Today, virtually every major bank offers a mobile banking app that allows customers to perform a wide range of transactions, from checking account balances to depositing checks.

Integration of new technologies (present to future)

Technological advancements like blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) will have a major impact on the future of digital banking. Blockchain technology is being utilized to increase the security and effectiveness of cross-border payments, with companies like Ripple partnering with banks around the world.

In addition, banks are already exploring using AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants to improve customer service. The banking sector is anticipated to change in the future due to the integration of these and other technologies, making it more effective and easy for customers.

Related: The role of biometrics in the metaverse

Furthermore, in the future, technologies such as biometrics and the Internet of Things (IoT) are likely to play an increasingly important role in digital banking, enabling customers to authenticate transactions using fingerprints or facial recognition and providing real-time insights into their financial health through connected devices.

 DeFi vs. Digital banking

To better understand the key differences between decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital banking, let’s closely examine their features and compare them.

DeFi has recently gained popularity as an alternative to traditional banking systems. DeFi is a blockchain-based financial system that allows anyone to participate and access financial services without intermediaries or centralized authorities. On the other hand, digital banking is a version of traditional banking that uses technology to offer services such as online banking, mobile banking and digital wallets.

As technology continues to evolve and disrupt traditional industries, the future of finance is becoming increasingly decentralized and democratized. However, while DeFi has a lot of potential, it still faces challenges in terms of scalability, security and mainstream adoption.

On the other hand, digital banking has already established itself as a mainstream industry and has been embraced by millions of users worldwide. However, digital banking is still largely centralized and controlled by traditional financial institutions, which limits its potential for democratization and innovation.

Radix, a layer-1 protocol, has partnered with LayerZero, an interoperability protocol, to integrate LayerZero with the Radix Babylon public network. The integration encourages cross-chain communication and asset transfers to the Radix ecosystem, benefitting both platforms and their users.

Web3 interoperability refers to the ability of different decentralized applications (DApps) and blockchain networks to communicate with one another. Put simply, interoperability is a state where blockchains can listen to each other, allow users to transfer digital assets and data, and enable better collaboration.

LayerZero’s technology enables decentralized applications to send messages between different blockchains. By integrating LayerZero into the Radix ecosystem, Radix users and developers will have a connected experience, making it possible for DApps and assets to unlock omnichain functionality.

Interoperability provides various advantages, one of which is the enhancement of functionality. With Web3 interoperability, various DApps can collaborate and integrate, broadening the scope of features they offer. This means that the integration of a decentralized finance protocol with a nonfungible token marketplace, for instance, enables users to utilize their NFTs as loan collateral.

Additionally, through interoperability, DApps can also leverage benefits such as increased liquidity sharing, which can result in a more comprehensive liquidity pool for the decentralized ecosystem. This, in turn, can minimize the fragmentation of liquidity across various blockchain networks. Moreover, DApps can exploit the security features of multiple blockchain networks, enhancing their overall security posture through interoperability.

Related: Web3 security: How to identify the risks and use protection tools?

Piers Ridyard, the Radix Foundation’s director, expressed enthusiasm about the integration, stating that it would showcase the potential of cross-chain interoperability. One of the fundamental principles of Web3 is decentralization, and greater decentralization is achievable with interoperability, as it can reduce the dominance of a single blockchain network.

The integration is set to launch in the second half of 2023, and it is expected to benefit the users of both platforms.

An anonymous Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bot operator has cashed in well over $1 million this week by executing “sandwich attacks” against buyers and sellers of two new meme coins.

The wallet address, linked to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain “jaredfromsubway.eth,” made $950,000 from the sandwich attacks on April 18 and profited about $300,000 and $400,000 on April 17 and 19, respectively, according to an April 19 tweet from nonfungible token data platform Sealaunch.

— sealaunch.xyz (@SeaLaunch_) April 19, 2023

The bot’s ENS domain is a likely tongue-in-cheek nod to the popular sandwich chain and its disgraced former spokesperson Jared Fogle.

Over a 24-hour period between April 18 to 19, 7% of all Ethereum gas fees were spent by the MEV bot, Sealaunch explained in a separate post.

A large proportion of the profits came from attacks on trading activity relating to two new meme coins, Pepe (PEPE) and Wojak (WOJAK), which has helped propel jaredfromsubway.eth to the become the largest gas guzzler over the last day and week, crypto researcher Matt Willemsen explained:

Wondering why gas is so damn high? ‍

jaredfromsubway.eth (lmao) is absolutely cleaning up by sandwich-attacking $PEPE and $WOJAK trading activity. They are #1 gas spender over the past day and week.

MEV sandwich bots on Ethereum have made $100M+ since the weekend. https://t.co/qhxyxlac20

— Matt Willemsen (@matt_willemsen) April 19, 2023

A sandwich attack occurs when an attacker “sandwiches” a victim’s transaction between their own two transactions in order to manipulate the price and profit from the user.

This is possible because the victim’s transaction is first sent to the mempool where it waits to be added to the next block. In the meantime, the attacker sets one transaction with a high gas fee — to ensure it is accepted first — and another transaction with a lower gas fee to ensure it is accepted after the victim's transaction.

The attacker profits by buying the victim’s token at a price cheaper than market value, then sells it within the same block — taking in the difference between the revenue from the transaction minus the gas fees.

The large profits pocketed by jaredfromsubway.eth came from nearly $1.2 million being spent on gas fees between April 18 and 19, according to data shared by Thomas Mattimore, head of platform at the Reserve Protocol.

The MEV bot operator has spent over $7 million in gas fees across 180,000 transactions, according to Sealaunch.

While some are finding the humor in the MEV bot’s domain name and actions, not all are happy.

One analyst for on-chain analytics firm Glassnode questioned the “value” of the work jaredfromsubway.eth is providing to the world.

Other Twitter users went one step further, expressing their hatred and frustration toward the MEV bot operator.

According to MEV Blocker, MEV bots have extracted more than $1.38 billion from Ethereum users attempting to trade, provide liquidity and mint NFTs.

Several MEV Block projects have been launched in recent months to help protect Ethereum users from sandwich attacks.

According to an April 19 post, Maple Finance has launched its new Cash Management Pool for institutional Web3 investors to access U.S. Treasury bills directly. The offering is not available to U.S. individuals or entities. The pool will source yield from one-month U.S. Treasury bills and reverse repurchase agreements, minus fees, to lenders, with crypto hedge fund Room40 Capital serving as the sole borrower via a special purpose vehicle (SPV). Maple developers wrote:

“Whilst there are a handful of ‘risk-free rate’ offerings on-chain, they do not provide the peace of mind necessary to attract hard earned treasury funds. Counterparty risk is either too high, assets too illiquid, too complicated with ETFs, or rates between 1-2% too low for the level of smart contract risk.”

Maple claimed that all pool assets are held in a standalone SPV “custodied by a regulated prime broker and Lenders have full recourse over all assets.” The firm also said that onboarding “takes between 10-15 minutes to complete,” and that interest accrues immediately from the time of deposit with no lock-up period.

“Lenders have a real-time view into the borrower’s portfolio of assets held with a regulated broker and interest statements can be downloaded at any time.”

Maple Finance is currently available on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, originating around $1.9 billion in loans since inception. U.S. Treasury bills are classified as securities. As a result, derivatives containing such instruments as the underlying asset cannot be sold to U.S. investors without registration or an exemption from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

According to an April 19 announcement from blockchain cybersecurity firm OpenZeppelin, app developers on Base can now use the Defender software to create multi-signature admin contracts and timelocks, employ Relayers to store keys and sign transactions along with creating automated “sentinels” to monitor the blockchain and react when events occur.

These tools can be used for routine but sensitive admin tasks such as upgrading contracts, tweaking numerical parameters, or pausing a contract should an emergency occur according to the program’s documentation.

The Defender app was available on Ethereum and most other networks in the past, but as it was not integrated with Base, developers could not use it on the new testnet until now.

OpenZeppelin chief technology officer Jonathan Alexander stated in the announcement that the integration will make smart contracts ""more secure and expansive,” while Base lead Jesse Pollak signaled excitement at the team-up, saying that “security is key for a thriving onchain ecosystem.""

Coinbase announced the launch of the Base test network on Feb. 23. It plans to produce a mainnet version as a layer-2 of Ethereum once testing is complete.

Some Ethereum users have speculated that Coinbase wants to help onboard institutional investors to Web3 through the new network as it will feature Masa Finance identity verification tools.

OpenZeppelin is most known for its library of open-source smart contracts that are often modified by developers and used for their own purposes throughout the Ethereum ecosystem.

ANALYSIS
Join us on social networks

Digital assets are typically restricted to their native blockchain networks, and existing methods of transferring tokens from one blockchain network to another are highly vulnerable to hacking or involve using a trusted third party. 

However, multichain tokens enable users to transfer their assets to another blockchain directly without giving up custody of their tokens.

Experts in the blockchain space believe that cross-chain tokens can positively impact the industry by enabling greater user participation over multiple networks.

Marius Ciortan, director of product engineering at Bitpanda and Pantos, a European crypto exchange, told Cointelegraph, “Multichain tokens can establish a more fluid and connected environment in the context of decentralized finance.”

Ciortan continued, “Multichain tokens, for example, can aid in developing more efficient decentralized exchanges by allowing users to trade assets across several blockchain networks. This can aid in improving liquidity and decreasing fragmentation in the DeFi ecosystem.”

Multichain tokens can also help connect blockchain networks, assisting developers in deploying their applications on multiple blockchains. Hoon Kim, chief technology officer at Astar Foundation, a layer-1 smart contract platform, agreed, telling Cointelegraph, “More asset and liquidity interoperability means more interdependence between ecosystems. This can expand the network to allow more innovation and increase the risk of failure when one asset loses its value.”

“But if an asset wants to increase its demand, we can see a future where more and more projects will aim to inject their assets into multiple networks and increase their utility,” Kim said.

Challenges with interoperability

Facilitating communication and interoperability among various blockchain networks heavily relies on interoperability protocols. However, interoperability protocols in the blockchain domain present several challenges that require resolution in order to ensure the seamless operation of the blockchain ecosystem.

The absence of standardization poses a significant obstacle to interoperability protocols. There are many different exchange protocols, and each one has a different design and framework. This means that the environment is full of different networks that don't work together.

Since there isn't much unity, it's hard for developers to make apps that can run on different blockchain networks and still work. Because of this, people who work in software development have to learn how to use different exchange standards, which can take a lot of time.

Scalability is another obstacle to interoperability protocols. Most interoperability protocols are specifically engineered to manage a restricted quantity of transactions, potentially impeding the flow of data in networks that experience high traffic levels.

As a result, the issue of scalability may lead to sluggish transaction processing, elevated fees and network overcrowding.

Recent: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?

To tackle this challenge, it is imperative to devise interoperability protocols capable of managing large quantities of transactions and expanding proportionately with the increasing adoption of blockchain technology.

Security is another noteworthy obstacle for interoperability protocols. The interconnectivity of blockchain networks is associated with an elevated likelihood of security breaches and hacks. The absence of security considerations during the design of an interoperability protocol can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities of which malevolent entities can take advantage.

Developers have stressed that it is imperative to design interoperability protocols with resilient security characteristics capable of safeguarding against potential attacks and upholding the authenticity of the blockchain ecosystem.

Ciortan said, “One of the biggest challenges we have seen across all interoperability projects in recent years is ensuring the system's security. Validation of events across multiple chains is a difficult task, and it takes a lot of work and research to develop a system that is robust enough to achieve this goal reliably and can stand the test of time.”

The challenge of addressing the complexity of interoperability protocols is a crucial matter that warrants attention. The intricacy of interoperability protocols necessitates a profound comprehension of cryptography, networking and distributed systems.

To get around these problems, the blockchain community has to work together to develop standards and best practices for interoperability protocols.

Kim also believes security is one of the major challenges concerning interoperability in the blockchain space. Kim said:

“Most bridge protocols are managed through a centralized server that facilitates a burn-and-mint function where the account is controlled via a multi-sig. But recently, we've been seeing a lot of ‘layer 0’ protocols with node validators and virtual machines to connect one blockchain with another.”

Centralized bridge protocols can be vulnerable to hacking, data breaches or other cyber attacks. If the central intermediary or other components of the bridge infrastructure are compromised, it can result in loss of assets, data leaks or other security breaches that can have serious consequences for users.

Since multichain token systems work by users swapping their tokens directly, without any intermediaries or bridges, this can help to address some of the challenges with traditional interoperability protocols.

Operating principles of a multichain token system

The Pantos group has created a novel benchmark called the Pantos Digital Asset Standard (PANDAS). The standard is the principal facilitator of tokens operating across multiple blockchain networks. Based on years of study, the Pantos team has developed a framework that allows tokens to interact smoothly with various blockchains.

Because Pantos is more of an infrastructure layer than a bridge, the PANDAS standard enables developers to deploy their existing tokens and newly created tokens on several blockchains without doing any maintenance work. This indicates that their tokens are on several chains and may be freely moved from one chain to another.

PANDAS does this via smart contracts, which are agreements that carry out themselves when specific circumstances are satisfied. In this scenario, the cross-chain transfer is made possible because of the smart contracts and a network of nodes.

For instance, if someone has an Ethereum-based token and wants to trade it on a BNB Chain DEX, they do not have to depend on a bridge to move a wrapped token to a different chain since they can utilize the Pantos technology to transfer their token to a new chain natively.

How does the multichain verification process work?

Pantos has been developing several validation procedures for a considerable period of time. The ultimate validation method is currently unreleased to the general public; however, it will constitute an enhanced iteration of the oracle-derived methodology.

The approach facilitates enhanced scalability and decreased gas fees while maintaining the system's security standards. Oracles are primarily utilized as instruments for making inquiries. For example, the oracle on a blockchain can be queried by any Pantos client to verify a transaction on a different blockchain.

The Oracle verification process is founded on a combination of threshold signature schemes and distributed key generation (DKG) protocols developed by Dan Boneh, Ben Lynn, and Hovav Shacham — computer scientists at Stanford University. These cryptographic techniques facilitate the authentication of signatories' legitimacy by users. The Boneh-Lynn-Shacham threshold signature allows users to verify that a signer is authentic, and DKG enables multiple parties to contribute to the calculation of a shared public and private key set.

The process is executed with a dual focus on economic and logistical efficiency, achieved through consolidating multiple signatures into a singular signature. In addition, the act of verifying a solitary signature can function as proof that the necessary minimum number of signatories backs the signed correspondence.

Pantos produces a decentralized private key, wherein the oracle nodes possess distinct private key shares, despite lacking ownership of the distributed private key. A public key, in essence, can be deemed analogous to a decentralized private key. Utilizing the private key shares possessed by the oracle nodes, the network can effectively consolidate their discoveries and generate an encoded message that can subsequently be deciphered using the public key.

If the oracle nodes undergo modification, all components, including the private key shares, the distributed private key and the public key, may undergo alteration. Typically, producing new keys necessitates oversight from a trustworthy individual in a position of authority. In contrast, Pantos employs DKG protocols to dispense with the requirement for a dependable authority.

Multichain token systems have the potential to revolutionize the blockchain industry and make DeFi more fluid and connected. By allowing users to transfer assets directly between blockchains without relying on intermediaries or bridges, multichain token systems provide an additional and efficient method for users to engage across multiple blockchain networks.

SafeMoon is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that runs on BNB Chain. It was hacked on March 28, resulting in a loss of 27,000 BNB, worth $8.9 million at the time.

On April 18, at 1:19 p.m. UTC, the SafeMoon Deployer account posted a transaction to the BNB network with the attacker’s address as the recipient. The transaction contained a coded message in 8-bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-8) that stated the following:

“SafeMoon has reached an agreement with the party currently holding the funds. Specifically, SafeMoon has agreed to accept 80 percent of the amount returned, with the other party retaining the balance as a bounty. SafeMoon has further agreed not to file any legal actions against them. After careful consideration of the circumstances, it is believed this is in the best interest of SafeMoon and the community.”

The coded message is the latest in a series of communications between the SafeMoon team and the attacker as the parties attempted to settle. On March 29, the attacker claimed they had drained the funds accidentally.

The team responded on the same day, asking the attacker to offer a Telegram handle where they could be contacted. The attacker did not provide a Telegram handle but did provide an anonymous Outlook email address instead. The team then stated, “Email message sent. 12:33 UTC.”

There was no further blockchain communication between the two sides until the April 18 message confirming that the agreement had been made.

Hacking DeFI protocols and negotiating to keep some funds has become common recently. On April 4, the Euler Finance attacker, who had previously drained over $196 million from Euler, issued an apology message and returned nearly all of the funds gained from the attack. On April 6, the exploiter who had drained $967,000 of crypto from Sentiment returned nearly 90% of it after the team agreed to let them keep the remaining amount.

Some Web3 developers have argued that bug bounties should be larger and development teams should be more diligent about paying them, as they allege this could motivate hackers to report bugs instead of exploiting them.
